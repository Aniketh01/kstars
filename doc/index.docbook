<abstract>
<para>&kstars; is a graphical desktop planetarium.
It plots the positions of stars, constellations, star clusters,
nebulae, galaxies and planets in the night sky for any date, from any
location on Earth.  The display can be panned and zoomed, and it can
even identify and track objects as they move across the sky.
&kstars; is highly configurable, you can
control what objects are displayed, and with what colors.  Images of
any part of the sky can be downloaded from online databases.  Our plan
is to make &kstars; an interactive tool for
learning about astronomy and the night sky.

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>&kstars; lets you explore the night sky from the comfort of your
computer chair.  It provides an accurate graphical representation of
the night sky for any date, from any location on Earth.  The display
includes 40,000 stars to 8th magnitude (well below the naked-eye
limit), 10,000 deep-sky objects (Messier, <acronym>NGC</acronym> and
<acronym>IC</acronym> catalogs), all planets, the Sun and Moon, the
Milky Way, and guide lines such as the celestial equator, horizon and
ecliptic.</para>

<para>
Please report bugs or feature requests to the &kstars; development
mailing list: <email>kstars-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</email>. You
can also use the automated bug reporting tool, accessible from the
<guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu.

<chapter id="using-kstars">
<title>A Quick Tour of &kstars;</title>

<para>This chapter introduces most of the useful features of &kstars;,
in the form of a guided tour.</para>

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Here's a screenshot of &kstars;</screeninfo>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="screen1.png" format="PNG" width="350"/>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>A screenshot of the &kstars; main window.</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>
In the above screenshot, you can see the sky display centered near the
constellation Sagittarius.  Mars is visible on the left, and there are
a couple dozen deep-sky objects (shown as colored symbols) on the
right.  Above the sky display, there is an information panel
displaying the current time and date (left), the coordinates of the
screen center (middle), and the current geographic location (right).
There is a toolbar and a menubar above the information panel.  There
is a status bar at the bottom of the window, which displays the
name of any object you click on, and the sky coordinates of the mouse
cursor. 
</para>

<sect1 id="geolocation">
<title>Where am I?</title>

<para>The first thing to do is to set the geographic location.  By
default, &kstars; assumes you are in Baltimore, Maryland, USA (just
because that is the author's hometown).  Since you are probably
somewhere else, you'll want to change this.</para>

<para>
Open the Change Geographic Location window by selecting
<guimenuitem>Geographic...</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Location</guimenu> menu, or by pressing the
<guiicon>Globe</guiicon> icon in the toolbar. 
</para>

<para>Here is the Change Location window:</para>

</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>A screenshot of the Change Location Window</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>
In the upper right, there is a list of 2000 predefined cities.  The
easiest way to set your location is to choose the nearest city from
this list.  Each city is represented in the world map as a small white
dot, and when a city is highlighted in the list, a red crosshairs
appears on its location in the map. 
</para>

<para>
The list of cities can be filtered by entering text in the boxes below
the map. For example, in the screenshot, the text <quote>Green</quote>
appears in the City filter text box.  Note that all of the cities in
the list begin with <quote>Green</quote>. 
</para>

<para>
The list can also be filtered by location.  Clicking anywhere in the
world map will show only those cities within two degrees of the
clicked location. 
</para>

<para>
If you want to use your exact coordinates or there is no predefined
city near your location, you can also manually define your location
using the four boxes at the bottom of the window.  Please note, this
feature is not fully supported yet.  Custom locations are not recorded
for future sessions in the current version. 
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="settime">
<title>What Time Is It?</title>

<para>
The next thing you may want to do is change the time and/or date.  By
default, the time is set to your computer's system clock, and the
&kstars; clock is running to keep up with the real time.  If you want to
stop the clock, select <guimenuitem>Stop Clock</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu, or simply press the
<guiicon>Pause</guiicon> icon in the toolbar.  You can make the clock
run slower or faster than normal using the time-step spinbox in the
toolbar. 
</para>

<para>
You can change to any time or date by selecting <guimenuitem>Set
Time...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu, or by
pressing the <guiicon>hourglass</guiicon> icon in the toolbar.  The
Set Time window uses a standard &kde; DatePicker widget, coupled with
three spinboxes for setting the hours, minutes and seconds.  If you
ever need to reset the clock back to the current time, just select
<guimenuitem>Set Time to Now</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu. 
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="lookaround">
<title>Have a Look Around!</title>

<para>
Now that we have the time and location set, let's have a look around.
You can pan the display using the arrow keys.  If you hold down the
shift key, the scrolling speed is doubled.  The display can also be
panned by clicking and dragging with the mouse.  Note that while the
display is scrolling, not all objects are displayed.  This is done to
cut down on the <acronym>CPU</acronym> load of recomputing object
positions, and make the scrolling smoother.  You can zoom in and out
with the <keycap>+</keycap> and <keycap>-</keycap> keys.  Notice that
as you zoom in, you can see fainter stars than at lower zoom settings.
</para>

<para>
Zoom out until you can see a green curve; this represents your local
horizon.  If you haven't adjusted the &kstars; configuration, the
display will be solid green below the horizon, representing the solid
ground of the Earth.  There is also a white curve, which represents
the celestial equator (an imaginary line which divides the sky into
northern and southern hemispheres).  There is also a yellow curve,
which represents the Ecliptic, the path that the Sun appears to follow
across the sky over the course of a year.  Therefore, the Sun is
always found somewhere along the Ecliptic, and the planets are never
far from it.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="skyobjects">
<title>Objects in the Sky</title>
<para>
&kstars; displays thousands of objects: stars, planets, clusters,
nebulae and galaxies.  You can identify any object by clicking on it
(its name appears in the statusbar at the bottom of the window.  You
can get more information about an object by right-clicking on it.  A
popup menu will appear, showing its name(s), object type, and links to
images and information from the internet. 
</para>

<para>
You can search for named objects by clicking on the
<guiicon>search</guiicon> icon in the toolbar, or by selecting
<guimenuitem>Find Object...</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Location</guimenu> menu.  The Find Object window lists all
the named objects in the &kstars; database.  Many objects are listed by
their catalog name (for example, NGC 3077), but some are listed by a
common name (for example, Whirlpool Galaxy).  You can filter the list
by name, or by object type.  Highlight the desired object, and press
<guibutton>OK</guibutton>.  The display will center on the object and
begin tracking it.</para>

<note><para>If the object is below the horizon, you may not see
anything except the ground.  You can make the ground invisible in the
Configuration window.  </para></note>

<para>
Object Tracking is automatically engaged whenever an object is
centered in the display, either by using the Find Object window, by
double-clicking on an object, or by selecting <guimenuitem>Center and
Track</guimenuitem> from the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> click
popup menu.  You can disengage tracking by panning the display,
pressing the <guiicon>Lock</guiicon> icon in the toolbar, or selecting
<guimenuitem>Track Object</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Location</guimenu> menu.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="config">
<title>Configuring &kstars;</title>
<para>
&kstars; has many configuration options, you can access them by
opening the Display Options window, either with the
<guiicon>wrench</guiicon> toolbar icon, or selecting
<guimenuitem>Configure KStars...</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>View</guimenu> menu.  The window is depicted below:</para>

Equatorial and Altitude/Azimuth coordinate systems.</para>

<note><para>The opaque ground can only be displayed in Alt/Az
coordinates.</para></note>

<para>In the <guilabel>Stars</guilabel> tab, you can toggle whether
any stars are displayed (SAO Star Catalog), set the faint limit for
named stars and for all stars, and toggle whether the names and/or
magnitudes (<acronym>aka</acronym> brightness) of the brighter stars
are displayed.  In the <guilabel>Catalogs</guilabel> tab, you can
toggle whether the deep sky catalogs are displayed.  The
<guilabel>Guides</guilabel> tab lets you toggle whether non-objects
are displayed (&ie;, constellation lines, constellation names, Milky
Way contour, celestial equator, ecliptic, horizon line, and opaque
ground).  In the <guilabel>Solar system</guilabel> tab, you can
specify whether the Sun, Moon and Plaents are displayed.  Finally, you
can set the color scheme in the <guilabel>Colors</guilabel> tab.
There are two predefined color schemes: the default scheme, and Night
Vision, which uses only shades of red to protect your dark-adapted
eyes.</para>

<para>
Mostly, the different colors indicate which catalog the object belongs
with (Messier, NGC or IC).  However, some objects have a different color

<question>
<para>Why can't I display the ground when using Equatorial Coordinates</para>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>
Why do the faint stars and non-Messier deep sky objects disappear
when I am scrolling the display?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
When you update the display's central position, &kstars; must recompute
the pixel coordinates of every object in its database, which involves
some pretty heavy trigonometry.  When scrolling the display (either
with the arrow keys or by dragging with the mouse), the display becomes
slow and jerky, because the computer is having trouble keeping up.
By excluding many of the objects, the computer can keep up and the
scrolling becomes fast and silky smooth!

<question>
<para>I don't understand all the terms used in &kstars;.  Where can I

<para>
We have started a project called <ulink

problem.  AstroInfo is the beginning of an interactive encyclopedia of
astronomy for which &kstars; will be the user interface and demo
engine.  Right now, it's just a collection of <acronym>HTML</acronym>
pages on various astronomy-related topics, with a particular focus on
the terms that &kstars; uses.  In the future, these articles will be
accessible directly from &kstars;, but for now, you'll have to browse
the articles separately.  AstroInfo is supposed to be a community
effort, like GNUpedia or Everything2.  If you'd like to contribute an
article to AstroInfo, please let us know!

<question>
<para>How accurate is &kstars;?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
&kstars; is pretty accurate, but it is not (yet) as accurate as it can
possibly be.  The problem with high-precision calculations is that
you start having to deal with a large number of complicating factors.
If you aren't a professional astronomer, you'll probably never have a
problem with its accuracy.  There are two occasions where it may be
noticeable:  eclipses, and rise/set times.  As discussed below, the
position of the Moon is extremely hard to predict with high precision,
so you probably cannot use &kstars; to predict eclipses at this time.
</para>
<para>
Here is a list of some of the factors we have not yet corrected
for:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The positions are not corrected for atmospheric refraction.
Light bends slightly as it passes through our atmosphere, which alters
the apparent positions of objects in the sky.  The effect is larger
for objects near the horizon.  For example, you may find that the
rise/set time predicted by &kstars; is off by a few minutes without
this correction.  We plan to correct for refraction in a future
version of &kstars;.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The positions of the planets are not corrected for the
<quote>Figure of the Earth</quote>.  The planets are shown as they
would be seen from the center of the Earth.  Since the Earth is about
6000 km in radius, the direction to a planet (and especially to the
moon, which is very nearby) will be slightly different from different
places on Earth.  We plan to make this correction in a future version
of &kstars;.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Planet positions are only accurate for dates within 4000 years
or so of the current epoch.  The planet positions are predicted using 
a fourier-like analysis of their orbits, as observed over the past few 
centuries.  We learned in school that planets follow simple elliptical
orbits around the Sun, but this isn't strictly true.  It would be true
only if there was only one planet in the Solar system, and if the Sun
and the planet were both point masses.  As it is, the planets are
constantly tugging on each other, perturbing the orbits slightly, and
tidal effects also induce precessional wobbling.  In fact, recent
analysis suggests that the planets' orbits may not even be stable in
the long term (&ie;, millions or billions of years).  As a rule of
thumb, you can expect the position of a planet to be accurate to a few
arcseconds (modulo the refraction and figure-of-earth errors)
between the dates -2000 and 6000.  
</para>

<para>
The moon and Pluto are exceptions to this.  Pluto's position is
perhaps 10 times less accurate, although its position for dates near
the present epoch are good to an arcsecond.  The moon's position is
probably the least accurate.  This is because it is quite perturbed by
the Earth, and because it is so close, even minute effects that would
be indetectable in more distant bodies are easily apparent in the
moon.  </para>

<para> The discussion of very remote dates is currently somewhat moot
because the <classname>QDate</classname> class we use for storing
dates does not allow dates prior to October 1752 (when the
currently-standard Gregorian calendar was adopted).  However, you can
enter future dates up to around 8000 AD.  We'd like to implement our
own date class that allows for more remote dates in the past.

<para>Can I help contribute to future versions of &kstars;?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes, definitely!  Introduce yourself on our mailing list:
<email>kstars-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</email>.  If you want to
help with the coding, you may want to look over the To-Do list on the 
webpage for some ideas of what's needed, and talk to current
developers about what we're working on.  
</para><para>
If you aren't into coding, we can still use your help with i18n, docs, 
AstroInfo, bug reports, and feature requests.

<title>How to obtain &kstars;</title>

<para>&kstars; is presently available as a source tarball, a Mandrake
RPM, a Debian package, or as CVS source.  If you'd like to contribute
a binary package for your favorite distribution, please let us
know!</para>

<para>
The latest &kstars; source code tarball can be obtained from <ulink
url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/kstars/">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/kstars/</ulink>.
It is also posted at the <ulink
url="http://kstars.sourceforge.net">KStars homepage</ulink>, at <ulink
url="http://apps.kde.com/uk/0/info/id/1050">apps.kde.com</ulink>, and
at <ulink
url="http://freshmeat.net/projects/kstars">freshmeat.net</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
If you want the latest development version of &kstars;, you can access
the CVS repository here: <ulink
url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=22914">http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=22914</ulink>.
</para>

<!-- Replace from here to end of section with -->
<!-- &install.intro.documentation; entity for KDE 3.x -->

<para>&kappname; is part of the &kde; project <ulink
url="&kde-http;">&kde-http;</ulink>.</para>

<para>&kappname; can be found in the &package; package on <ulink

<sect1 id="requirements">
<title>Requirements</title>

<para>
In order to successfully run &kstars;, you need &kde; >=2.1 and &Qt;
>=2.2.4.  It may run on &kde; 2.0 (and a similarly deprecated &Qt;),
but this has not been tested.  If you try, please contact us with the
results (success or failure)!
</para>

<para>
To compile &kstars;, you will also have to have the following packages
installed: </para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>kdelibs-devel</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>libqt2-headers</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>zlib-devel</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>autoconf</command> less than 2.5!!</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Autoconf 2.5 is (apparently) incompatible with the files
generated by <application>KDevelop</application>. </para>

<para>On my system, &kstars; uses about 50 MB of system memory. Most
of this usage is due to the loaded object databases.  If &kstars; is
idling, it uses very little <acronym>CPU</acronym>; but it will use as
much as you've got when panning or zooming.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="compilation">
<title>Compilation and Installation</title>

<!-- replace this next section with the -->
<!-- &install.compile.documentation; entity for KDE 3.x -->

<para>In order to compile and install &kappname; on your system, type the
following in the base directory of the &kappname; distribution:</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput><command>./configure</command></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput><command>make</command></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput><command>make</command> install</userinput>
</screen>

<para>Since &kappname; uses <command>autoconf</command> and
<command>automake</command> you should have no trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the &kstars;
mailing list <email>kstars-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</email>.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="configuration">
<title>Configuration</title>

<para>
At this point, there are no special configuration options or
requirements.  If &kstars; complains that there are missing data
files, become <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> and
manually copy all files in <filename
class="directory">kstars/data/</filename> to <filename
class="directory">$<envar>KDEDIR</envar>/apps/kstars/</filename>. (If
you don't have <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
priveliges, copy them to <filename
