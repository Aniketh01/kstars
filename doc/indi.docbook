<para>
KStars can control local and remote devices seemlessly via the <link linkend="what-is-indi">INDI</link> server/client architecture. The local/server setup is used to control a local device (i.e. a device attached to your machine) and it is also used to establish a server that remote clients can connect to. A remote/client setup is used to connect a client to remote hosts running an INDI server.</para>

<para>Controlling your telescope with KStars requires few simple steps. It
is <emphasis>vital</emphasis> to complete each step before moving to the
next one.</para>

<sect1 id="indi-telescope-setup">
<title>Telescope Setup</title>
<para>Most telescopes are equipped with <hardware>RS232</hardware> interface
for remote control. Connect the RS232 jack in your telescope to your
computer's <hardware>Serial/USB</hardware> port. Traditionally, the RS232
connects to the serial port of your computer, but since many new laptops
abandoned the serial port in favor of <hardware>USB/FireWire</hardware>
ports, you might need to obtain a Serial to USB adapter to use with new
laptops.</para>

<para>After connecting your telescope to the Serial/USB port, turn your
telescope on. It is <emphasis>highly</emphasis> recommended that you
download and install the latest firmware for your telescope
controller.</para>

<para>The telescope needs to be aligned before it can be used properly.
Align your telescope (one or two stars alignment) as illustrated in your
telescope manual.</para>

<title>Advanced INDI Control</title>

<para>
The INDI control panel offers many device properties not accessible from the
sky map. The properties offered differ from one device to another.
Nevertheless, all properties share common features that constrains how they
are displayed and used:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Permission: All properties can either be read-only, write-only, or read and
write enabled. An example of a read-write property is the telescope's Right
Ascension. You can enter a new Right Ascension and the telescope, based on
current settings, will either slew or sync to the new input. Furthermore,
when the telescope slews, its Right Ascension gets updated and sent back to
the client.</para><para></para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>State: Prefixed to each property is a state indicator (round LED).
Each property has a state and an associated color code:</para>

Context: Numerical properties can accept and process numbers in two formats:
decimal and sexigismal. The sexagesimal format is convenient when expressing

<para>KStars provides a simple yet powerful layer for remote device control.
A detailed description of the layer is described in the INDI <ulink

<para>Server: To prepare a device for remote control, follow the same steps in the <link linkend="indi-kstars-setup">local/server</link> setup. When you start a device service in the <guimenu>Device Manager</guimenu>, a port number is displayed under the <guilabel>Listening port</guilabel> column.

<sect2 id="indi-commandline">
<title>Running an INDI server from the command line</title>
<para>While &kstars; allows you to easily deploy an INDI server; you can
lunch an INDI server from the command line. One advantage of the command
line is that device drivers log messages to <constant>stderr</constant> and
that can be helpful in a debugging situation. The syntax for INDI server is
as following:</para>

<para>$ <command>indiserver</command> [options] [<filename>driver</filename>
...]</para>

<para>Options:</para>
<para> -p p  : alternate IP port, default 7624</para>
<para> -r n  : max restart attempts, default 2</para>
<para> -v    : more verbose to stderr</para>

<para>For example, if you want to start an INDI server running an LX200 GPS
driver and listening to connections on port 8000, you would run the
following command:</para>

<title>INDI Frequently Asked Questions</title>

<qandaset defaultlabel="qanda">
<qandaentry>
<question id="what-is-indi">
<para>What is INDI?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para> <acronym>INDI</acronym> is the <ulink url="http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/INDI/INDI.pdf"> Instrument-Neutral-Distributed-Interface</ulink> control protocol developed by <author><firstname>Elwood</firstname><surname>C.
Downey</surname></author> of <ulink url="http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/">ClearSky Institute</ulink>. &kstars; employs device drivers that are compatible with the INDI protocol. INDI has many advantages including loose coupling between hardware devices and
software drivers. Clients that use the device drivers (like &kstars;) are completely unaware of the device capabilities. In run time, &kstars; communicates with the device drivers and builds a completely dynamical GUI based on services provided by the device. Therefore, new device drivers can be written or updated and KStars can take full advantage of them without any changes on the client side.</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>
What devices does KStars support?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Currently, &kstars; supports LX200 Classic, LX200 Autostar, LX200 GPS, LX200
16", and Celestron GPS.
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>
Do you plan to support more devices?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes. We plan to support major CCD cameras and focusers and extend support
for more telescopes. If you'd like INDI to support a particular device,
please send an email to <email>mutlaqja@ikarustech.com</email>
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>I don't have a serial port, how can I connect to the telescope?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>Many modern laptops do not have a serial port. You will need a
Serial To USB adapter that is supported under Linux. For example,
<trademark>Keyspan</trademark>'s USA-19QW Serial to USB adapter is well
supported under Linux and had been tested with &kstars;. You need to refer
to your adapter's documentation to find which ports they provide (e.g.
<constant>/dev/ttyUSB0 .... /dev/ttyUSB9</constant>).
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>
When I try to <guibutton>Connect</guibutton>, &kstars; reports that the
telescope is not connected to the serial/USB port. What can I do?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>This messaged is triggered when &kstars; cannot communicate with the telescope. Here are few things you can do:</para>

   <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
<para>Check the connection cable, make sure it is in good condition and test it with other applications.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
<para>Check your telescope power, make sure the power is on and that the telescope is getting enough power.</para>

   <listitem>
   <para>Restart &kstars; and retry again.</para>
   </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>&kstars; reports that the telescope is online and ready, but I can't find the telescope's crosshair, where is it?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>&kstars; retrieves the telescopes RA and DEC coordinates upon connection. If your alignment was performed correctly, then you should see the crosshair around your target in the Sky Map. However, the RA and DEC coordinates provided by the telescope may be incorrect (even below the horizon) and you need to <link linkend="indi-sync">Sync</link> your telescope to your current target.</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>The telescope is moving erratically or not moving at all. What can I do?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>This behavior is mostly due to incorrect settings, please verify the following check list:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Is the telescope aligned?</para>
</listitem>
