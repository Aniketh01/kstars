<title>Configuring &kstars;</title>
<para>
&kstars; has many configuration options, which you can access by opening
the <guilabel>Display Options</guilabel> window, either with the
<guiicon>configure</guiicon> toolbar icon, or selecting <guimenuitem>Configure
&kstars;...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu.  The
window is depicted below:

The <guilabel>Display Options</guilabel> window is divided into five 
tabs:
<guilabel>Catalogs</guilabel>, <guilabel>Guides</guilabel>, 
<guilabel>Solar System</guilabel>, <guilabel>Colors</guilabel>, and 
<guilabel>Advanced</guilabel>.  
Below the tabs, you can choose between Equatorial and Horizontal 
<link linkend="ai-skycoords">coordinate systems</link>.  Note that 
changes you make in this window are reflected immediately in the map, 
but that the changes are not committed until you press the 
<guibutton>Ok</guibutton> button.
</para>
<para>
In the <guilabel>Catalogs</guilabel> tab, you determine which object 
catalogs are displayed in the map.  The SAO star catalog also allows 
you to set the <quote>faint <link linkend="ai-magnitude">magnitude</link> 
limit</quote> for stars, and the 
<link linkend="ai-magnitude">magnitude</link> limit for displaying the 
names and/or magnitudes of stars.  Below the stars section, there is a 
box containing a list of checkboxes for the available deep-sky object 
catalogs.  You can add your own custom object catalogs by pressing the 
<guibutton>Add Custom Catalog</guibutton> button, which will open a 
<guilabel>File Dialog</guilabel>, so that you can point it to your 
catalog data file.  For detailed instructions on preparing a catalog 
data file, see the <filename>README.customize</filename> file that 
ships with &kstars;.
</para>
<para>
In the <guilabel>Solar System</guilabel> tab, you can specify whether 
the Sun, Moon, planets, comets and asteroids are displayed, and 
whether the major bodies are drawn as circles or actual images.  You
can also toggle whether solar system bodies have name labels attached,
and control how many of the comets and asteroids get name labels.  
There is an option to automatically attach a temporary trail whenever 
a solar system body is tracked, and another to toggle whether the color 
of the planet trail fades into the background sky color.
</para>
<para>
The <guilabel>Guides</guilabel> tab lets you toggle whether non-objects 
are displayed (&ie;, constellation lines, constellation names, the 
Milky Way contour, the <link linkend="ai-cequator">celestial 
equator</link>, <link linkend="ai-ecliptic">the ecliptic</link>, <link 
linkend="ai-horizon">the horizon line</link>, and the opaque ground).  
You can also choose whether you would like to see Latin constellation 
names, <acronym>IAU</acronym>-standard three-letter abbreviations, or 
constellation names using your local language.
</para>
<para>
The <guilabel>Colors</guilabel> tab allows you to set the color scheme, 
and to define custom color schemes.  The tab is split into two panels:
</para><para>
The left panel shows a list of all display items with adjustable
colors.  Click on any item to bring up a color selection window to 
adjust the color.  Below the list is the <guilabel>Star Color 
Mode</guilabel> selection box.  By default, &kstars; draws stars with 
a <link linkend="ai-colorandtemp">realistic color</link> tint according 
to the spectral type of the star.  However, you may also choose to draw 
the stars as solid white, black or red circles.  If you are using the 
realistic star colors, you can set the saturation level of the star 
colors with the <guilabel>Star Color Intensity</guilabel> spinbox.
</para>
<para>
The right panel lists the defined color schemes.  There are four 
predefined schemes: the <guilabel>Default</guilabel> scheme, 
<guilabel>Star Chart</guilabel>, which uses black stars on a white 
background, <guilabel>Night Vision</guilabel>, which uses only shades 
of red in order to protect dark-adapted vision, and <guilabel>Moonless 
Night</guilabel>, a more realistic, dark theme.  Additionally, 
you can save the current color settings as a custom scheme by clicking 
the <guibutton>Save Current Colors</guibutton> button.  It will prompt 
you for a name for the new scheme, and then your scheme will appear in 
the list in all future &kstars; sessions.  To remove a custom scheme, 
simply highlight it in the list, and press the <guibutton>Remove Color 
Scheme</guibutton> button.
</para><para>
The <guilabel>Advanced</guilabel> Tab provides fine-grained control 
over the more obscure behaviors of &kstars;.
</para><para>
The <guilabel>Correct for atmospheric refraction</guilabel> checkbox
controls whether the positions of objects are corrected for the effects 
of the atmosphere.  Because the atmosphere is a spherical shell, light from 
outer space is <quote>bent</quote> as it passes through the atmosphere to 
our telescopes or eyes on the surface.  The effect is largest for objects 
near the horizon, and actually changes the predicted rise or set times of 
objects by a few minutes!  In fact, when you <quote>see</quote> a sunset, 
the Sun's actual position is already well below the horizon; atmospheric 
refraction makes it seem as if the Sun is still in the sky!  Note that 
atmospheric refraction is never applied if you are using 
<guilabel>Equatorial coordinates</guilabel>.
</para><para>
The <guilabel>Use animating slewing</guilabel> checkbox controls how the 
display changes when a new focus position is selected in the map.  By 
default, you will see the sky drift or <quote>slew</quote> to the new 
position; if you uncheck this option, then the display will instead 
<quote>snap</quote> immediately to the new focus position.
</para><para>
If the <guilabel>Attach label to centered object</guilabel> checkbox is 
selected, then a name label will automatically be attached to an object 
when it is being tracked by the program.  The label will be removed when 
the object is no longer being tracked.  Note that you can also manually 
attach a persistent name label to any object with its <link 
linkend="popupmenu">popup menu</link>.
</para><para>
There are three situations when &kstars must redraw the sky display very 
rapidly: when a new focus position is selected (and <guilabel>Use 
animated slewing</guilabel> is checked), when the sky is dragged with the 
mouse, and when the time step is large.  In these situations, the positions
of all objects must be recomputed as rapidly as possible, which can put 
a large load on the <abbrev>CPU</abbrev>.  If the <abbrev>CPU</abbrev> 
cannot keep up with the demand, then the display will seem sluggish or jerky.  
To mitigate this, &kstars; will hide certain objects during these rapid-redraw 
situations, as long as the <guilabel>Hide objects while moving</guilabel> 
checkbox is selected.  The timestep threshhold above which objects will be 
hidden is determined by the <guilabel>Also hide if timescale greater 
than:</guilabel> timestep-spinbox.  You can specify the objects that should 
be hidden in the <guilabel>Configure Hidden Objects</guilabel> group box.
