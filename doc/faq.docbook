<question>
<para>What is the &kstars; Icon?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
The <guiicon>&kstars; Icon</guiicon> is a sextant, a handheld telescope which
was used by navigators on sailing ships back when the stars were important for
navigation. By carefully reckoning the positions of the stars, the navigator
could get an accurate estimate of the ship's current <link 
linkend="ai-geocoords">longitude and latitude</link>.

<question>
<para>What do the different colors of Deep-sky objects mean?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Generally, the different colors indicate to which catalog the object 
belongs (Messier, NGC or IC).  However, some objects have a different 
color which indicates that there are extra images available in the 
<link linkend="popup-menu">popup menu</link> (the default 
<quote>extras</quote> color is red).

<question>
<para>
Why are there so many more U.S. cities than in other countries?  Is it a
conspiracy?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
It may be a conspiracy, but &kstars; is not involved!  We were unable to
find a single longitude/latitude database that covers the globe equitably.
We are currently working on adding many more non-U.S. cities to the 
database.  We have already received city lists from users in Norway, Italy
and Korea.  If you can contribute to this effort, please let us know.

<question>
<para>Why can't I display the ground when using Equatorial Coordinates</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
The short answer is, this is a temporary limitation.  There is a
problem when constructing the filled polygon that represents the ground
when in Equatorial mode.  However, it doesn't make too much sense to draw 
the ground in equatorial coordinates, which is why this fix has been given 
a low priority.

<question>
<para>
Why do the faint stars and non-Messier deep sky objects disappear
when I am scrolling the display?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
When you update the display's central position, &kstars; must recompute
the pixel coordinates of every object in its database, which involves
some pretty heavy trigonometry.  When scrolling the display (either
with the arrow keys or by dragging with the mouse), the display becomes
slow and jerky, because the computer is having trouble keeping up.
By excluding many of the objects, the computational load is greatly 
reduced, which allows for smoother scrolling.  You can turn off this 
feature in the View Options window, or even customize which objects 
get hidden.

<question>
<para>I don't understand all the terms used in &kstars;.  Where can I
learn more about the astronomy behind the program?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
The &kstars; Handbook includes the <link linkend="astroinfo">AstroInfo 
Project</link>; a series of short, hyperlinked articles about 
astronomical topics that can be explored and illustrated with &kstars;.
AstroInfo is a community effort, like GNUpedia or Everything2.  If 
you'd like to contribute to AstroInfo, please join our mailing list: 
<email>kstars-info@lists.sourceforge.net</email>.

<question>
<para>How accurate/precise is &kstars;?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
&kstars; is pretty accurate, but it is not (yet) as precise as it can
possibly be.  The problem with high-precision calculations is that
you start having to deal with a large number of complicating factors.
If you aren't a professional astronomer, you'll probably never have a
problem with its accuracy or precision.  There are two occasions where 
it may be noticeable:  eclipses, and rise/set times.  As discussed 
below, the position of the Moon is extremely hard to predict with high 
precision, so you probably cannot use &kstars; to predict eclipses at 
this time.
</para>
<para>
Here is a list of some of the complicating factors which limit the 
program's precision:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Planet positions are only accurate for dates within 4000 years
or so of the current epoch.  The planet positions are predicted using
a Fourier-like analysis of their orbits, as observed over the past few
centuries.  We learned in school that planets follow simple elliptical
orbits around the Sun, but this isn't strictly true.  It would be true
only if there was only one planet in the Solar system, and if the Sun
and the planet were both point masses.  As it is, the planets are
constantly tugging on each other, perturbing the orbits slightly, and
tidal effects also induce precessional wobbling.  In fact, recent
analysis suggests that the planets' orbits may not even be stable in
the long term (i.e., millions or billions of years).  As a rule of
thumb, you can expect the position of a planet to be accurate to a few
arcseconds between the dates -2000 and 6000.
</para><para>
Pluto is the exception to this; its position is perhaps ten times less 
precise than the positions of the other planets.  Still, for dates 
near the present epoch, its position can be trusted to about an 
arcsecond.
</para><para>
The moon's position is the most difficult to predict to high precision.
This is because its motion is quite perturbed by the Earth.  Also, 
since it is so nearby, even minute effects that would be indetectable 
in more distant bodies are easily apparent in the moon.  
</para><para>
The objects with the worst long-term precision in the program are the 
comets and asteroids.  We use a very simplistic orbital model for the 
minor planets that does not include third-body perturbations.  
Therefore, their positions can only be trusted for dates near the 
present epoch.  Even for the present epoch, one can expect positional 
errors among the minor planets of order 10 arcseconds or more.
</para><para>
The discussion of very remote dates is currently somewhat moot because
the QDate class we use for storing dates does not allow dates prior to
October 1752 (when the currently-standard Gregorian calendar was
adopted; see the article on <link linkend="ai-leapyear">Leap 
Years</link>).  However, you can enter future dates up to around 8000 
AD.  We'd like to implement our own date class that allows for more 
remote dates in the past.

<question>
<para>Can I help contribute to future versions of &kstars;?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes, definitely!  Introduce yourself on our mailing list:
<email>kstars-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</email>.  If you want to
help with the coding, download the latest <ulink 
url="http://edu.kde.org/kstars/cvs.html">CVS</ulink> version of the 
code and dive right in.  There are several README files in the 
distribution that explain some of the code's subsystems.  If you
need ideas of what to work on, see the TODO file.  You can submit 
patches to kstars-devel, and feel free to post any questions you 
have about the code there as well.  
</para><para>
If you aren't into coding, we can still use your help with i18n, docs,
AstroInfo articles, URL links, bug reports, and feature requests.
