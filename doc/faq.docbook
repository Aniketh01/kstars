<question>
<para>What is the &kstars; Icon?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
The <guiicon>&kstars; Icon</guiicon> is a sextant, a handheld telescope which
was used by navigators on sailing ships back when the stars were important for
navigation. By carefully reckoning the positions of the stars, the navigator
could get an accurate estimate of the ship's current longitude and latitude.

<question>
<para>What do the different colors of Deep-sky objects mean?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Mostly, the different colors indicate which catalog the object belongs
with (Messier, NGC or IC).  However, some objects have a different color
(the default is red).  This indicates that there are extra images available
in the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> click popup menu.

<question>
<para>
Why are there so many more U.S. cities than in other countries?  Is it a
conspiracy?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
It may be a conspiracy, but &kstars; is not involved!  We were unable to
find a longitude/latitude database that covers the globe more equitably.
We are currently working on adding many more non-U.S. cities to the database.
If you can contribute to this effort, please let us know.

<question>
<para>Why can't I display the ground when using Equatorial Coordinates</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
The short answer is, this is a temporary limitation.  There is a
problem when constructing the filled polygon that represents the ground
when in Equatorial mode.

<question>
<para>
Why do the faint stars and non-Messier deep sky objects disappear
when I am scrolling the display?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
When you update the display's central position, &kstars; must recompute
the pixel coordinates of every object in its database, which involves
some pretty heavy trigonometry.  When scrolling the display (either
with the arrow keys or by dragging with the mouse), the display becomes
slow and jerky, because the computer is having trouble keeping up.
By excluding many of the objects, the computer can keep up and the
scrolling becomes fast and smooth!

<question>
<para>I don't understand all the terms used in &kstars;.  Where can I
learn more about the astronomy behind the program?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
We have started the AstroInfo project to address this
problem.  AstroInfo is the beginning of an interactive encyclopedia of
astronomy for which &kstars; will be the user interface and demo
engine.  Right now, it's just a collection of HTML pages on various
astronomy-related topics, with a particular focus on the terms that
&kstars; uses.  These articles are presented later in this document.
AstroInfo is supposed to be a community effort, like GNUpedia or Everything2.
If you'd like to contribute an article to AstroInfo, please let us know!

<question>
<para>How accurate is &kstars;?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
&kstars; is pretty accurate, but it is not (yet) as accurate as it can
possibly be.  The problem with high-precision calculations is that
you start having to deal with a large number of complicating factors.
If you aren't a professional astronomer, you'll probably never have a
problem with its accuracy.  There are two occasions where it may be
noticeable:  eclipses, and rise/set times.  As discussed below, the
position of the Moon is extremely hard to predict with high precision,
so you probably cannot use &kstars; to predict eclipses at this time.
</para><para>
Here is a list of some of the factors we have not yet corrected for:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
The positions are not corrected for atmospheric refraction.  Light
bends slightly as it passes through our atmosphere, which alters the
apparent positions of objects in the sky.  The effect is larger for
objects near the horizon.  For example, you may find that the rise/set
time predicted by &kstars; is off by a few minutes without this
correction.  We plan to correct for refraction in a future version of
&kstars;.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The positions of the planets are not corrected for the <quote>Figure
of the Earth</quote>.  The planets are shown as they would be seen
from the center of the Earth.  Since the Earth is about 6000 km in
radius, the direction to a planet (and especially to the moon, which
is very nearby) will be slightly different from different places on
Earth.  We plan to make this correction in a future version of
&kstars;.
</para></listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Planet positions are only accurate for dates within 4000 years
or so of the current epoch.  The planet positions are predicted using
a fourier-like analysis of their orbits, as observed over the past few
centuries.  We learned in school that planets follow simple elliptical
orbits around the Sun, but this isn't strictly true.  It would be true
only if there was only one planet in the Solar system, and if the Sun
and the planet were both point masses.  As it is, the planets are
constantly tugging on each other, perturbing the orbits slightly, and
tidal effects also induce precessional wobbling.  In fact, recent
analysis suggests that the planets' orbits may not even be stable in
the long term (i.e., millions or billions of years).  As a rule of
thumb, you can expect the position of a planet to be accurate to a few
arcseconds (modulo the refraction and figure-of-earth errors)
between the dates -2000 and 6000.
</para><para>
The moon and Pluto are exceptions
to this.  Pluto's position is perhaps 10 times less accurate, although
its position for dates near the present epoch are good to an
arcsecond.  The moon's position is probably the least accurate.  This
is because it is quite perturbed by the Earth, and because it is so
close, even minute effects that would be indetectable in more
distant bodies are easily apparent in the moon.
</para><para>
The discussion of very remote dates is currently somehwat moot because
the QDate class we use for storing dates does not allow dates prior to
October 1752 (when the currently-standard Gregorian calendar was
adopted).  However, you can enter future dates up to around 8000 AD.
We'd like to implement our own date class that allows for more remote
dates in the past.

<question>
<para>Can I help contribute to future versions of &kstars;?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes, definitely!  Introduce yourself on our mailing list:
<email>kstars-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</email>.  If you want to
help with the coding, you may want to look over the <ulink
url="http://kstars.sourceforge.net/kstars-todo.html">To-Do list</ulink> on the
webpage for some ideas of what's needed, and talk to current developers about
what we're working on.
</para><para>
If you aren't into coding, we can still use your help with i18n, docs,
AstroInfo articles, bug reports, and feature requests.
