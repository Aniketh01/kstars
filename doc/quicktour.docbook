<para> 
In the above screenshot, you can see the sky display centered on 
Betelgeuse, the brightest star in the constellation Orion.  Orion 
has just risen above the eastern horizon horizon.  
Stars are displayed with <link linkend="ai-colorandtemp">realistic 
colors</link> and relative brightnesses.  The brightest stars have 
their names labeled (&eg;, Betelgeuse).  M 42, the Orion Nebula, is 
visible to the right of Orion's <quote>belt</quote> stars, just 
above the horizon.  If you look closely, you can see the planet Saturn, 
and comets Russel and LINEAR (2002 X1).  In three corners of the Sky 
display, there are on-screen text labels displaying data on the current 
time (<quote>LT: 12:29:51 03/23/03</quote>), the current Geographic 
Location (<quote>Baltimore, Maryland, USA</quote>), and the current 
object in the center of the display (<quote>Focused on: Betelgeuse 
(alpha Orionis)</quote>).  Above the sky display, there are two 
toolbars.  The main toolbar contains shortcuts for 
<link linkend="kstars-menus">menu functions</link>, as well as a 
time-step widget which controls how fast the simulation clock runs.  
The view toolbar contains buttons that toggle the display of different 
kinds of objects in the sky.  At the bottom of the window, there is a 
status bar which displays the name of any object you click on, and the 
<link linkend="ai-skycoords">sky coordinates</link> (Right Ascension 
and Declination) of the mouse cursor.  
</para>

<sect1 id="geolocation">
<title>Where am I?</title>
<para>
The first thing to do is to set the geographic location.  By default,
&kstars; assumes you are in Greenwich, UK (home of the Royal Observatory,
where <link linkend="ai-geocoords">longitude</link>=0 is defined).  Since 
you are probably somewhere else, you'll want to change this.
</para>
<para>
Open the <guilabel>Set Geographic Location</guilabel> window by selecting
<guimenuitem>Set Geographic Location...</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu, or by pressing the
<guiicon>Globe</guiicon> icon in the toolbar, or by typing 
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>g</keycap></keycombo>.

</para>

<para>
There is a list of over 2500 predefined cities available to choose from. 
You set your location by highlighting a city from this list.  Each
city is represented in the world map as a small dot, and when a city
is highlighted in the list, a red crosshairs appears on its location
in the map.
</para>

<para>It isn't practical to scroll through the full list of 2500 locations,
looking for a specific city. To make searches easier, the list can be
filtered by entering text in the boxes below the map. For example, in
the screenshot, the text <quote>Ba</quote> appears in the
<guilabel>City Filter</guilabel> box, while <quote>M</quote> has been
entered in the <guilabel>Province Filter</guilabel> box, and
<quote>USA</quote> is in the <guilabel>Country Filter</guilabel>
box. Note that all of the cities displayed in the list have city,
province, and country names that begin with the entered filter
strings, and that the message below the filter boxes indicates that 7
cities are matched by the filters.  Also notice that the dots
representing these seven cities in the map have been colored white,
while the unmatched cities remain grey.
</para><para>
The list can also be filtered by location in the map.  Clicking anywhere 
in the world map will show only those cities within two degrees of the 
clicked location.  At this time, you can search by name, or by location, 
but not both at once.  In other words, when you click on the map, the
name filters are ignored, and vice versa.
</para><para>
The <link linkend="ai-geocoords">longitude, latitude</link> and 
<link linkend="ai-timezones">time zone</link> information for the 
currently-selected location are displayed in the boxes at the bottom of 
the window.  If you feel that any of these values are inaccurate, you 
can modify them and press the <guibutton>Add to List</guibutton> button 
to record your custom version of the location.  You can also define a 
completely new location by pressing the 
<guibutton>Clear Fields</guibutton> button, and entering the data for 
the new location.  Note that all fields except the optional 
<guilabel>State/Province</guilabel> must be filled before the new 
location can be added to the list.  &kstars; will automatically load 
your custom locations for all future sessions.  Please note, at this 
point, the only way to remove a custom location is to remove the 
appropriate line from the file
<filename>~/.kde/share/apps/kstars/mycities.dat</filename>.
</para><para>
If you add custom locations (or modify existing ones), please send us 
your <filename>mycities.dat</filename> file so that we can add your 
locations to the master list.
</para>

<sect1 id="settime">
<title>What Time Is It?</title>
<para>
The next thing you may want to do is change the time and/or date.  
When &kstars; starts up, the time is set to your computer's system 
clock, and the &kstars; clock is running to keep up with the real time.  
If you want to stop the clock, select <guimenuitem>Stop 
Clock</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu, or simply 
click on the <guiicon>Pause</guiicon> icon in the toolbar.  You can 
make the clock run slower or faster than normal, or even make it run 
backward, using the time-step spinbox in the toolbar.  This spinbox 
has two sets of up/down buttons.  The first one will step through all 
83 available time steps, one by one.  The second one will skip to the 
next higher (or lower) unit of time, which allows you to make large 
timestep changes more quickly.    
</para>
<para>
You can change to any time or date by selecting <guimenuitem>Set
Time...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu, or by
pressing the <guiicon>time</guiicon> icon in the toolbar.  The
<guilabel>Set Time</guilabel> window uses a standard &kde; Date Picker 
widget, coupled with three spinboxes for setting the hours, minutes and 
seconds.  If you ever need to reset the clock back to the current time, 
just select <guimenuitem>Set Time to Now</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu.</para>

<note><para>
The current version of &kstars; cannot 
accept dates before October 1, 1752, nor dates after the year 8000.  
These are limitations of the &Qt; Date/Time class.  We may implement 
our own date/time class in a future version.
</para></note>

<sect1 id="lookaround">
<title>Have a Look Around!</title>
<para>
Now that we have the time and location set, let's have a look around.
You can pan the display using the arrow keys.  If you hold down the
&Shift; key before panning, the scrolling speed is doubled.  The
display can also be panned by clicking and dragging with the mouse.  
Note that while the display is scrolling, not all objects are 
displayed.  This is done to cut down on the <acronym>CPU</acronym> load 
of recomputing object positions, which makes the scrolling smoother 
(you can configure what gets hidden while scrolling in the <link 
linkend="config">Display Options</link> window).  

There are five ways to change the magnification (or 
<firstterm>Zoom level</firstterm>) of the display:</para>

<para>Notice that as you zoom in, you can see fainter stars than at
lower zoom settings.</para> 

<para>
Zoom out until you can see a green curve; this represents your local
<link linkend="ai-horizon">horizon</link>.  If you haven't adjusted 
the default &kstars; configuration, the display will be solid green 
below the horizon, representing the solid ground of the Earth.  There 
is also a white curve, which represents the <link 
linkend="ai-cequator">celestial equator</link>, and a tan curve, which 
represents the <link linkend="ai-ecliptic">Ecliptic</link>, the path 
that the Sun appears to follow across the sky over the course of a 
year.  The Sun is always found somewhere along the Ecliptic, and the 
planets are never far from it.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="skyobjects">
<title>Objects in the Sky</title>
<para>
&kstars; displays thousands of celestial objects: stars, planets, 
comets, asteroids, clusters, nebulae and galaxies.  By default, stars 
are drawn as white circles with a colored border that simulates the 
star's real color.  Planets are drawn as colored dots at low zoom 
levels, but as an actual image of the planet as you zoom in.  Deep-sky 
objects (clusters, nebulae and galaxies) are drawn with symbols 
color-coded to indicate the catalog to which they belong (Messier, NGC 
or IC).  Most Messier objects are drawn as real images on the map at 
higher zoom levels.  Deep-sky objects with extra image or information 
links available are drawn with a special color (red by default).  
Clicking on an object will identify it in the status bar.  Double 
clicking will recenter the display on the object and begin tracking 
the object (so that it will remain centered as time passes).  
<mousebutton>Right</mousebutton> clicking an object opens a popup menu 
with more options.
</para>

<sect2 id="popupmenu">
<title>The Popup Menu</title>

<para>
Here is an example of the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> click popup 
menu, for the Orion Nebula:
</para>

  </textobject>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>
The appearance of the popup menu depends somewhat on the kind of
object you <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> click on, but the basic
structure is listed below.  You can get 
<link linkend="popup-menu">more detailed information about the popup 
menu</link>.
</para>

<para> 
The top section contains information labels (which are not selectable).  
The top one to three labels display the object's name(s) and object 
type.  The next three labels show the object's rise, transit, and 
set times.
</para>
<para>
The middle section contains items for performing actions on the object, 
such as <guimenuitem>Center and Track</guimenuitem>, 
<guimenuitem>Details...</guimenuitem> (which opens the object's 
<link linkend="tool-details">Detailed Information Dialog</link>), 
<guimenuitem>Add Label</guimenuitem>, and 
<guimenuitem>Add/Remove Trail</guimenuitem> (only for Solar System 
bodies).
</para>
<para>
The bottom section contains links to images and/or informative webpages 
about the selected object.  If you know of an additional &URL; with 
information or an image of the object, you can add a custom link to the 
object's popup menu using the <guimenuitem>Add Link...</guimenuitem> 
item.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="findobjects">
<title>Finding Objects</title>
<para> 
You can search for named objects using the <guilabel>Find 
Object</guilabel> window, which can be opened by clicking on the
<guiicon>search</guiicon> icon in the toolbar, by selecting 
<guimenuitem>Find Object...</guimenuitem> from the 
<guimenu>Focus</guimenu> menu, or by pressing 
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>F</keycap></keycombo>.  
The <guilabel>Find Object</guilabel> window is shown below:

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Find Object Window</screeninfo>
<mediaobject>

    <imagedata fileref="find.png" format="PNG"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject>
    <phrase>Find Object Window</phrase>
  </textobject>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
The window contains a list of all the named objects that &kstars; is 
aware of.  Many objects are listed only by 
their catalog name (for example, NGC 3077), but some are also listed 
by a common name as well (for example, Whirlpool Galaxy).  You can 
filter the list by name, or by object type.  Highlight the desired 
object in the list, and press <guibutton>Ok</guibutton>.  The display 
will center on the object and begin tracking it.  Note that if the 
object is below the horizon, the program will warn you that you may 
not see anything except the ground (you can make the ground 
invisible in the <guilabel>Display Options</guilabel> window, or by 
pressing the <guiicon>Ground</guiicon> button in the View toolbar).
</para>
<para> 
Object Tracking is automatically engaged whenever an object is
centered in the display, either by using the <guilabel>Find
Object</guilabel> window, by double-clicking on an object, or by
selecting <guimenuitem>Center and Track</guimenuitem> from the
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton>-click popup menu.  You can disengage
tracking by panning the display, pressing the <guiicon>Lock</guiicon>
icon in the Main toolbar, or selecting <guimenuitem>Track
Object</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Focus</guimenu> menu.  
</para>

</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="customize"> 
<title>Customizing the Display</title> 

<para> There are several ways to modify the display to your liking.
First of all, you can select a different color scheme in the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Color
Schemes</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu.  There are three predefined
color schemes, and you can define your own in the <link 
linkend="config"><guilabel>View Options</guilabel></link> window.  You 
can hide the Toolbars in the 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Toolbars</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
menu, and hide the Info Boxes in the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Info
Boxes</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu.  In addition, you can
manipulate the three Info Boxes with the mouse.  Each box has 
additional lines of data that are hidden by default.  You can toggle 
whether these additional lines are visible by double-clicking a box to
<quote>shade</quote> it.  Also, you can reposition a box by dragging
it with the mouse.  When a box hits a window edge, it will
<quote>stick</quote> to the edge when the window is resized.</para>

<para>The remaining customizations are covered in the next chapter.</para>
