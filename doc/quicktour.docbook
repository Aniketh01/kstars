<para>
In the above screenshot, you can see the sky display centered on
Betelgeuse, the brightest star in the constellation Orion.  Orion
has just risen above the eastern horizon horizon.
Stars are displayed with <link linkend="ai-colorandtemp">realistic
colors</link> and relative brightnesses.  The brightest stars have
their names labeled (&eg;, Betelgeuse).  M 42, the Orion Nebula, is
visible to the right of Orion's <quote>belt</quote> stars, just
above the horizon.  If you look closely, you can also see the planet
Saturn in the upper left.  In three corners of the Sky
display, there are on-screen text labels displaying data on the current
time (<quote>LT: 12:29:51 03/23/03</quote>), the current Geographic
Location (<quote>Baltimore, Maryland, USA</quote>), and the current
object in the center of the display (<quote>Focused on: Betelgeuse
(alpha Orionis)</quote>).  Above the sky display, there are two
toolbars.  The main toolbar contains shortcuts for
<link linkend="kstars-menus">menu functions</link>, as well as a
time-step widget which controls how fast the simulation clock runs.
The view toolbar contains buttons that toggle the display of different
kinds of objects in the sky.  At the bottom of the window, there is a
status bar which displays the name of any object you click on, and the
<link linkend="ai-skycoords">sky coordinates</link> (Right Ascension
and Declination) of the mouse cursor.

<indexterm><primary>Geographic Location Tool</primary></indexterm>
The first thing to do is to set the geographic location.  By default,
&kstars; assumes you are in Greenwich, UK (home of the Royal Observatory,
where <link linkend="ai-geocoords">longitude</link>=0 is defined).  Since
you are probably somewhere else, you'll want to change this.
</para>
<para>
Open the <guilabel>Set Geographic Location</guilabel> window by selecting
<guimenuitem>Set Geographic Location...</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu, or by pressing the
<guiicon>Globe</guiicon> icon in the toolbar, or by typing
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>g</keycap></keycombo>.

</para>

<para>
There is a list of over 2500 predefined cities available to choose from.
You set your location by highlighting a city from this list.  Each
city is represented in the world map as a small dot, and when a city
is highlighted in the list, a red crosshairs appears on its location
in the map.
</para>

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Geographic Location Tool</primary><secondary>Filtering</secondary></indexterm>
It isn't practical to scroll through the full list of 2500 locations,
looking for a specific city. To make searches easier, the list can be
filtered by entering text in the boxes below the map. For example, in
the screenshot, the text <quote>Ba</quote> appears in the
<guilabel>City Filter</guilabel> box, while <quote>M</quote> has been
entered in the <guilabel>Province Filter</guilabel> box, and
<quote>USA</quote> is in the <guilabel>Country Filter</guilabel>
box. Note that all of the cities displayed in the list have city,
province, and country names that begin with the entered filter
strings, and that the message below the filter boxes indicates that 7
cities are matched by the filters.  Also notice that the dots
representing these seven cities in the map have been colored white,
while the unmatched cities remain gray.
</para><para>
The list can also be filtered by location in the map.  Clicking anywhere
in the world map will show only those cities within two degrees of the
clicked location.  At this time, you can search by name, or by location,
but not both at once.  In other words, when you click on the map, the
name filters are ignored, and vice versa.
</para><para>
<indexterm><primary>Geographic Location Tool</primary><secondary>Custom locations</secondary></indexterm>
The <link linkend="ai-geocoords">longitude, latitude</link> and
<link linkend="ai-timezones">time zone</link> information for the
currently-selected location are displayed in the boxes at the bottom of
the window.  If you feel that any of these values are inaccurate, you
can modify them and press the <guibutton>Add to List</guibutton> button
to record your custom version of the location.  You can also define a
completely new location by pressing the
<guibutton>Clear Fields</guibutton> button, and entering the data for
the new location.  Note that all fields except the optional
<guilabel>State/Province</guilabel> must be filled before the new
location can be added to the list.  &kstars; will automatically load
your custom locations for all future sessions.  Please note, at this
point, the only way to remove a custom location is to remove the
appropriate line from the file
<filename>~/.kde/share/apps/kstars/mycities.dat</filename>.
</para><para>
If you add custom locations (or modify existing ones), please send us
your <filename>mycities.dat</filename> file so that we can add your
locations to the master list.

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Date and Time</primary>
<secondary>Synching with system clock</secondary></indexterm>
The next thing you may want to do is change the time and/or date.
When &kstars; starts up, the time is set to your computer's system
clock, and the &kstars; clock is running to keep up with the real time.
If you want to stop the clock, select <guimenuitem>Stop
Clock</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu, or simply
click on the <guiicon>Pause</guiicon> icon in the toolbar.  You can
make the clock run slower or faster than normal, or even make it run
backward, using the time-step spinbox in the toolbar.  This spinbox
has two sets of up/down buttons.  The first one will step through all
83 available time steps, one by one.  The second one will skip to the
next higher (or lower) unit of time, which allows you to make large
timestep changes more quickly.
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Date and Time</primary>
<secondary>Setting</secondary></indexterm>
You can change to any time or date by selecting <guimenuitem>Set
Time...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu, or by
pressing the <guiicon>time</guiicon> icon in the toolbar.  The
<guilabel>Set Time</guilabel> window uses a standard &kde; Date Picker
widget, coupled with three spinboxes for setting the hours, minutes and
seconds.  If you ever need to reset the clock back to the current time,
just select <guimenuitem>Set Time to Now</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Time</guimenu> menu.</para>

<secondary>Limitations of QDate class</secondary></indexterm>
The current version of &kstars; cannot
accept dates before October 1, 1752, nor dates after the year 8000.
These are limitations of the &Qt; Date/Time class.  We plan to implement
our own date/time class in a future version, which will allow for more
remote dates.

<para>
<indexterm><primary>Navigation Controls</primary>
<secondary>Basics</secondary></indexterm>
Now that we have the time and location set, let's have a look around.
You can pan the display using the arrow keys.  If you hold down the
&Shift; key before panning, the scrolling speed is doubled.  The
display can also be panned by clicking and dragging with the mouse.
Note that while the display is scrolling, not all objects are
displayed.  This is done to cut down on the <acronym>CPU</acronym> load
of recomputing object positions, which makes the scrolling smoother
(you can configure what gets hidden while scrolling in the <link
linkend="config">Display Options</link> window).

There are seven ways to change the magnification (or
<firstterm>Zoom level</firstterm>) of the display:</para>

<para>
Zoom out until you can see a green curve; this represents your local
<link linkend="ai-horizon">horizon</link>.  If you haven't adjusted
the default &kstars; configuration, the display will be solid green
below the horizon, representing the solid ground of the Earth.  There
is also a white curve, which represents the <link
linkend="ai-cequator">celestial equator</link>, and a tan curve, which
represents the <link linkend="ai-ecliptic">Ecliptic</link>, the path
that the Sun appears to follow across the sky over the course of a
year.  The Sun is always found somewhere along the Ecliptic, and the
planets are never far from it.

<sect1 id="skyobjects">
<title>Objects in the Sky</title>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Objects in the Sky</primary><secondary>Overview</secondary></indexterm>
&kstars; displays thousands of celestial objects: stars, planets,
comets, asteroids, clusters, nebulae and galaxies.  By default, stars
are drawn as white circles with a colored border that simulates the
star's real color.  Planets are drawn as colored dots at low zoom
levels, but as an actual image of the planet as you zoom in.  Deep-sky
objects (clusters, nebulae and galaxies) are drawn with symbols
color-coded to indicate the catalog to which they belong (Messier, NGC
or IC).  Most Messier objects are drawn as real images on the map at
higher zoom levels.  Deep-sky objects with extra image or information
links available are drawn with a special color (red by default).
Clicking on an object will identify it in the status bar.  Double
clicking will recenter the display on the object and begin tracking
the object (so that it will remain centered as time passes).
<mousebutton>Right</mousebutton> clicking an object opens a popup menu
with more options.

<title>Finding Objects</title>
<indexterm><primary>Find Object Tool</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>Objects in the Sky</primary><secondary>Finding by Name</secondary></indexterm>
<para>
You can search for named objects using the <guilabel>Find
Object</guilabel> window, which can be opened by clicking on the
<guiicon>search</guiicon> icon in the toolbar, by selecting
<guimenuitem>Find Object...</guimenuitem> from the
<guimenu>Focus</guimenu> menu, or by pressing
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>F</keycap></keycombo>.
The <guilabel>Find Object</guilabel> window is shown below:

</para>

<para>
The window contains a list of all the named objects that &kstars; is
aware of.  Many of the objects only have a numeric catalog name (for
example, NGC 3077), but some objects have a common name as well (for
example, Whirlpool Galaxy).  You can filter the list by name and
by object type.  To filter by name, enter a string in the edit box
at the top of the window; the list will then only contain names
which start with that string.  To filter by type, select a type
from the combo box at the bottom of the window.
</para><para>
Highlight the desired object in the list, and press
<guibutton>Ok</guibutton>.  The display will center on the object.
Note that if the object is below the horizon, the program will warn
you that you may not see anything except the ground (you can make
the ground invisible in the <guilabel>Display Options</guilabel>
window, or by pressing the <guiicon>Ground</guiicon> button in
the View toolbar).
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary>Objects in the Sky</primary><secondary>Tracking</secondary></indexterm>
&kstars; will automatically begin tracking on an object whenever one
is centered in the display, either by using the <guilabel>Find
Object</guilabel> window, by double-clicking on it, or by
selecting <guimenuitem>Center and Track</guimenuitem> from its
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton>-click popup menu.  You can disengage
tracking by panning the display, pressing the <guiicon>Lock</guiicon>
icon in the Main toolbar, or selecting <guimenuitem>Track

Choose an <quote>FOV Symbol</quote> using the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>FOV Symbols</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
menu.  <firstterm>FOV</firstterm> is an acronym for <quote>field-of-view</quote>.
An FOV symbol is drawn at the center of the window to indicate where the display
is pointing.  Different symbols have different angular sizes; you can use a symbol to show
what the view through a particular telescope would look like.  For example, if you choose
the <quote>7x35 Binoculars</quote> FOV symbol, then a circle is drawn on the display that is
9.2 degrees in diameter; this is the field-of-view for 7x35 binoculars.

This window lets you modify the four properties that define a FOV symbol: name, size,
shape, and color.  The angular size for the symbol can either be entered directly in the
<guilabel>Field of View</guilabel> edit box, or you can use the Eyepiece/Camera Tabs to
calculate the field-of-view angle, given parameters of your telescope/eyepiece or
telescope/camera setup.  The four available shapes are: Circle, Square, Crosshairs, and
Bullseye.  Once you have specified all four parameters, press <guibutton>Ok</guibutton>,
and the symbol will appear in the list of defined symbols.  It will also be available
from the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> | <guisubmenu>FOV</guisubmenu> menu.
