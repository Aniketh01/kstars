## New KStars TODO list:  January 2013
## Announce interest in working on these on kstars-devel@kde.org
## suggest new items on the same list or at http://bugs.kde.org

0. Release Critical:
--------------------

- Massimiliano's bug on Hipparcos epoch not being J2000.0

- Update FOV indicator in status bar correctly

- Merge Samikshan's work

- Database problems

1. Bug reports to be resolved:
------------------------------

2. Other required fixes:
------------------------

- Massimiliano's bug on the Mailing List -- Hipparcos epoch is not
   J2000.0

- M 17 position is off

- Combine various telescope info into the userDB

3. Wishlist stuff
-----------------

- Make DSS source user-configurable

- Move storage of DSS and other images to the user database

- Improved observation logging support using the userDB

- JMoons tool: show dates rather than day offset; show position of moons at t0

- More fine-grained lunar phases. We have too few images to give a
  good representation of the lunar phase.

- More information in moon phase calendar. Show also illuminated
  fraction and magnitude, and indicate new moon and full moon.

4. Larger New Feature Ideas
---------------------------

- Move to MarbleWidget for Geographic Location selection

- Almanac tool (sun events, moon events, planet events, etc)

- Support multiple DSS sources

- SIMBAD / VizieR queries from Find Dialog and import result into
   KStars' catalog DB.

- Solar system viewer: more interactive; independent clock; include minor bodies

- Countour lines for nebulae

- Indicate binarity/variability of stars on map?

- Better rendering of comets and asteroids

- Improve the Star Hopper and give it a good interface. Also make it
   DBus accessible.

5. Large projects
-----------------

- Add more planet satellites

- Add Earth satellites (man-made)

- Update moon position code to Meeus 1998.

6. Ever-present needs
---------------------

- Translations

- Improve documentation

- More AstroInfo articles

- More internet links
