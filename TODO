KStars 0.7 To-Do list:
[Oct 2001]

See the KStars Homepage (kstars.sourceforge.net) for the most
up-to-date to-do list.

+ Bug Fixes
  - Phantom Constellation Line:
    A constellation line is incorrectly drawn from (RA, Dec)=0.0, 0.0
    to a point off the screen to the upper left, whenever this point
    is near the center of the display.

  - Small gap in Horizon:
    There is a very small gap in the Horizon line when in
    Altitude/Azimuth coordinates.  The gap is not visible if the
    "opaque ground" view option is checked.

  - Small gaps in Milky Way contour:
		Similar gaps are seen in some parts of the Milky Way countour.

  - Southern Constellations need Lines:
    Many constellations near the south celestial pole do not have
    constellation lines.

+ GUI Improvements
  - Customizable info panel:
    Some users may prefer a smaller infopanel with less information,
    or even no panel at all.  This should be configurable.

  - Detailed information popup window:
    Show detailed information for an object (depending on its type):
    Rise/set/transit times, object type (for messier/NGC/IC),
    distance/mass/radius/satellites (for planets), spectral type (for
    stars), etc.

  - "What's up tonight?" window:
    Popup dialog listing "interesting" objects that are visible in the
    sky, for the current date and location. Option to show this
    window whenever KStars starts, or even whenever the date changes.

  - Realistic angular sizes for pixmapped objects:
    Planets and Messier objects are currently shown much larger than
    actual size.

+ Add Functionality
  - Add minor planets and comets
  - Allow ephemerides of planetary bodies to be updated from online
    sources (e.g., JPL)
  - Add more star names
  - Add contour lines tracing the Magellanic Clouds
  - Include Position Angle information for Galaxies
  - Ability to add new URLs to popup menu for any location
  - Ability to add text annotation to popup menu for any location
  - Add realistic sky-lighting effects?
  - Add more catalogs?  (too many objects may slow KStars down, but
    we can do tricks like ignoring objects that are outside the
    viewable area...boy, that would be nice, can't figure out how
    to do it quckly though)
  - Improve accuracy of positions.  Correct for aberration, atmospheric
    refraction, and the figure of the Earth.

+ Ever-present needs
  - Translations
  - Improve Documentation
