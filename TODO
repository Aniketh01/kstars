KStars 1.0.x To-Do list:
[updated April 2003]

+ Bug Fixes
  - Audit object catalogs; verify/improve accuracy of data.

+ GUI Improvements
  - What's Up Tonight Window: add option to show only evening/morning
    also add an option to show only abjects brighter than some limit.

  - AAVSO Lightcurve generator: better integration with KStars; for example,  
    option to download lightcurve should appear in popup menu of variable 
    stars.

  - Generalized plot widget to be used for various tools (Alt vs Time, Solar
    System Viewer, Jupiter moons, etc)

  - Solar system viewer (a.k.a. "orrery", a rather unfortunate word)

  - Tool to plot positions of Jupiter's moons as a function of time.

  - Add "What's this" functionality (perhaps tied to AstroInfo).

  - Should night vision mode change desktop colors? (bug 43595)

  - Add labels along ecliptic, equator and grid lines (bug 51299)

  - Better rendering of asteroids and comets

  - Add alternative projection schemes

+ Add Functionality
  - Add moons for planets other than Jupiter

  - Indicate on the map whether stars are multiple or variable.

  - Allow ephemerides of planetary bodies to be updated from online
    sources (e.g., JPL)

  - Ability to measure angular distance between objects (from the 
    popup menu, perhaps).

  - Add contour lines tracing the Magellanic Clouds and other nebulae

  - Add realistic sky-lighting effects?

  - Add more catalogs?  

  - Finish DCOP functions

  - Ability to construct spreadsheet-like observing lists.

  - add command-line option to dump the sky image to a file without launching GUI
    (useful for using KStars as dynamic background generator, and possibly as the 
    basis for a screensaver)

+ Long-term wishlist:
  - KStars: The Screensaver!  
    A "lite" version of KStars to be used as a screensaver. A few
    thousand stars plus the planets would not use much CPU. Could also
    optionally run in an accelerated-time mode in which the sky could
    be seen to  rotate with respect to the horizon. Plus, you'd see
    the Sun, moon and  planets drifting by, with the moon's phases
    changing. Sounds pretty neat! Unfortunately, I have no screensaver
    experience, and am having too much fun right now on regular KStars
    to think much about this part. Someday, I'll do it (unless you
    want to! :)  

  - OpenGL rendering of the sky

+ Ever-present needs
  - Translations
  - Improve documentation
  - More AstroInfo articles
  - More internet links
