KStars 0.9.X To-Do list:
[updated Feb 2003]

+ Bug Fixes
  - data in some astrocalculator fields is being ignored.  
    Known to exist in Day duration module.

  - Attempt to add custom city claims fields are empty, even when 
    all fields are filled.

  - Audit object catalogs; verify/improve accuracy of data.

+ GUI Improvements
  - "What's up tonight?" window:
    Popup dialog listing "interesting" objects that are visible in the
    sky, for the current date and location. Option to show this
    window whenever KStars starts, or even whenever the date changes.

  - Solar system viewer (a.k.a. "orrery", a rather unfortunate word)

  - Finish Altitude vs. time window. 

  - Add a "What's this" button.

  - Should night vision mode change desktop colors? (bug 43595)

  - add labels along ecliptic, equator and grid lines (bug 51299)

  - better rendering of asteroids and comets

+ Add Functionality
  - Add moons for planets other than Jupiter

  - Indicate on the map whether stars are multiple or variable.

  - finish minor planets (increase number of objects in catalogs; 
    add a spinbox to select how many to display/how many to label)

  - Allow ephemerides of planetary bodies to be updated from online
    sources (e.g., JPL)

  - Add contour lines tracing the Magellanic Clouds and other nebulae

  - Add realistic sky-lighting effects?

  - Add more catalogs?  

+ Long-term wishlist:
  - KStars: The Screensaver!  
    A "lite" version of KStars to be used as a screensaver. A few
    thousand stars plus the planets would not use much CPU. Could also
    optionally run in an accelerated-time mode in which the sky could
    be seen to  rotate with respect to the horizon. Plus, you'd see
    the Sun, moon and  planets drifting by, with the moon's phases
    changing. Sounds pretty neat! Unfortunately, I have no screensaver
    experience, and am having too much fun right now on regular KStars
    to think much about this part. Someday, I'll do it (unless you
    want to! :)  

  - KStars: The Scripting Language!
    This is already underway in the form of our DCOP interface.  We 
    need to add more functions (tracking, focus-to-coordinates, wait 
    for N seconds, and even things like opening small text windows and 
    drawing lines and arrows), and provide an easy way to write scripts 
    (such as recording manual actions, or providing a window with a 
    listbox of all the functions).

  - AstroInfo
    These last two items could be integrated into a comprehensive,
    interactive astronomy encyclopedia. It would be similar to other
    open online encyclopedias (everything2, wikipedia, GNUpedia): 
    user-contributed articles, and hyperlinks to other articles or to 
    websites. The difference would be that it could also "link" to
    KStars, and perhaps spawn a script that illustrates the article's
    topic. There are already some AstroInfo articles on the KStars
    webpage. I'll be including the first iteration of it in KStars
    soon (it will probably start out as just a menu item or button
    that spawns konqueror open to an index of articles). 

+ Ever-present needs
  - Translations
  - Improve documentation
  - More AstroInfo articles
