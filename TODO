## KStars TODO list:  updated August 2003
## Brackets indicate a developer who has expressed interest in this item.
## Contact that developer before working on the item to avoid collisions.
## announce interest in working on these on kstars-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
## suggest new items at http://bugs.kde.org

+ Bug Fixes
  - Replace SAO star catalog with Hipparcos/Tycho catalog [Harris]

  - Create UI files for dialogs:  Details[Harris], ...

  - Separate "planets" from "comets/asteroids" in control of hidden objects
    in Advanced Tab of Options window.

+ GUI Improvements
  - dmsBoxes could have slightly different backround or text color, to 
    indicate that they are not normal edit boxes (?).

  - Should night vision mode change desktop colors? (bug 43595)

  - Add labels along ecliptic, equator and grid lines (bug 51299)

  - Better rendering of asteroids and comets

  - Add alternative projection schemes

  - Add contour lines tracing the Magellanic Clouds and nebulae

  - Zoom-dependent faint limit should apply to non-stellar objects as well.

+ Tools/Dialogs
  - What's Up Tonight Window: add option to show only evening/morning
    also add an option to show only abjects brighter than some limit.

  - Manual Focus window: ability to specify epoch [Harris]

  - Finish Solar system viewer (add labels to planets) [Harris]

  - Add airmass to Details dialog [Harris]

  - Add distance from Earth/Sun to Planet's Details window.

+ Add Functionality
  - Add command-line option(s) to dump the sky image to a file without launching 
    the GUI (useful for using KStars as dynamic background generator, and possibly 
    as the basis for a screensaver/"live" desktop mode) [Harris; in progress]

  - Add transparent-overlay to skymap that can be updated at a different rate than
    the underlying sky image (i.e., more rapidly).  Already sort-of use this for 
    the infoboxes.  Also useful for other on-screen effects like the target symbols,
    automatic, transient object IDs, display of cursor's coords right next to cursor, 
    etc. [Harris]

  - Add "What's this" functionality (perhaps tied to AstroInfo). 

  - Indicate on the map whether stars are multiple or variable [Harris]
    (part of change to Tycho star catalog)

  - Ability to measure angular distance between objects (from the 
    popup menu, perhaps).

  - Finish DCOP functions [Harris]

  - Ability to construct spreadsheet-like observing lists. [Mutlaq?]

+ Long-term/wishlist:
  - KStars: The Screensaver!  
    A "lite" version of KStars to be used as a screensaver. A few
    thousand stars plus the planets would not use much CPU. Could also
    optionally run in an accelerated-time mode in which the sky could
    be seen to  rotate with respect to the horizon.      want to! :)  

  - OpenGL rendering of the sky; realistic sky-lighting effects.

  - Add moons for planets other than Jupiter (long-term)

  - Allow ephemerides of planetary bodies to be updated from online
    sources (e.g., JPL)

  - Implement our own Date/Time class that allows for very remote dates

+ Ever-present needs
  - Translations

  - Improve documentation

  - More AstroInfo articles

  - More internet links
