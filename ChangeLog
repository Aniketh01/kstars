is resized.  Improved startup speed and vastly improved speed of the 
"Find Object" function.

image and information links.  Most Messier objects now shown as inline images 
directly on the sky map.  Expanded number of internet links.  Added Pluto.

Automated object tracking when an object is centered.  Display name and
coordinates of centered object in the infoPanel.  Fixed "extra layout" error
messages.  Improved efficiency of KSPlanet::findPosition().  Initial startup
parameters make more sense.  If focus point is below horizon when KStars
restarts, a warning message is triggered.  Also, if it is shut down while
tracking an object, it will still be tracking when restarted.  Choose latin or
localized constellation names.  Various bug fixes and minor improvements.
