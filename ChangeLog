KStars Revision History

0.1 (Altair): first public release

0.2 (Betelgeuse): added global coverage to city database

0.3 (Castor): added Messier objects, constellation lines, image downloads,
drag sky w/ mouse.

0.4 (Deneb): Added customizable display options, including color palette.
Implemented Alt/Az Coordinate system. Added optional opaque
horizon. Expanded star catalog. Deep-sky objects symbols indicate object type,
and color indicates catalog. Added NGC/IC catalog. Added links to HST press
release images. Added Find-by-name function. Updated documentation.

0.5 (Enif): Added Sun and all planets except Pluto.  Reorganized view 
options dialog.  Added Splash Screen, with loading messages.

0.6 (Fomalhaut): Added the moon, with phases.  Reorganized the InfoPanel 
widget (and painted it black).  The sky map now stretches when the window 
is resized.  Improved startup speed and vastly improved speed of the 
"Find Object" function.

0.7 (Gemini): Added realistic star colors.  Added ability to provide custom 
image and information links.  Most Messier objects now shown as inline images 
directly on the sky map.  Expanded number of internet links.  Added Pluto.
Added Milky Way countour.  Added spectral type of stars to popup menu.
Automated object tracking when an object is centered.  Display name and
coordinates of centered object in the infoPanel.  Fixed "extra layout" error
messages.  Improved efficiency of KSPlanet::findPosition().  Initial startup
parameters make more sense.  If focus point is below horizon when KStars
restarts, a warning message is triggered.  Also, if it is shut down while
tracking an object, it will still be tracking when restarted.  Choose latin or
localized constellation names.  Various bug fixes and minor improvements.

0.8 (Hydra):  
Sky display: Milky Way is now filled.  Added coordinate grid.  Reorganized 
"colors" tab in options window.  Added options to show constellation names 
in native language, or as official IAU abbreviations.  Popup menu now shows 
Rise/Set times of the object.  Added "genetive" star names (e.g., 
"alpha Orionis").  Added keyboard shortcuts to center on planets, and on 
cardinal direction points along the horizon (N, S, E, W).
	
Customization: Ability to add custom geographic locations, custom URLs, 
and custom color schemes.  Added "star chart" predefined color scheme.  

Geographic locations: Added about 80 non-US cities to locations database.  
Improved determination of a location's time zone.  Added optional "Province" 
field to geolocation database.
	
Documentation: Updated Handbook.  Added AstroInfo articles to the Handbook. 
Added toolbar button to launch handbook browser
	
Performance: Improved memory handling (unused objects are not loaded into 
memory on startup).  Various bug fixes.

0.9 (Indus):
Display Features:
- Configurable InfoPanel: can choose to show parts of infopanel, or hide it all.
- Added planet name labels
- Planet sizes much more realistic
- Added many more zoom levels
- KDE3 automatically alpha-blends the planet, Messier, and star bitmaps in the sky map.

Other Features:
- Added AstroCalc calculator dialog
- Added wider range of timesteps
- Time can now run backwards
- Improved selection of object when mouse is clicked.  It now prefers brighter objects,
  and it picks planets first, followed by Messier, NGC, IC, and stars.
- Added DCOP interface, which will form the foundation of our scriptable behavior features.

Calculation Accuracy:
- More accurate Planet positions:  now properly include aberration, nutation, light travel time
  delay.  Planet positions are calculated more often.
- Atmospheric refraction: in Alt/Az mode, we include the effect of our atmosphere, which
  bends light that passes through it, slightly altering the positions of objects in the sky.

Code efficiency: major code overhauls to improve performance and memory usage, and to make
greater use of C++'s OOP features.
