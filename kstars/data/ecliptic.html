<h1>The Ecliptic</h1>
The ecliptic is an imaginary <a href="greatcircle.html">great circle</a>
on the <a href="csphere.html">Celestial Sphere</a> along which the Sun
appears to move over the course of a year.  Of course, it is really the
Earth's orbit around the Sun causing the change in the Sun's apparent
direction.  The ecliptic is inclined from the Celestial Equator by 23.5
degrees.   The two points where the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator are
known as the <a href="equinox.html">equinoxes</a>.
<p>
Since our solar system is relatively flat, the orbits of the planets are
also close to the plane of the ecliptic.  In addition, the constellations of the
zodiac are located along the ecliptic. This makes the ecliptic a very useful
line of reference to anyone attempting to locate the planets or the
constellations of the zodiac, since they all literally 'follow the sun.'
<p>
The altitude of the ecliptic above the horizon changes over the course of the
year, because of the 23.5 degree tilt of the Earth's spin axis; this causes the
seasons.  When the ecliptic (and therefore the Sun) is high above the horizon,
the days are longer, and you have summer. When the ecliptic is low in the sky,
you have Winter.

<b>Exercise:</b> Switch to horizontal coordinates with the opaque ground shown
(in the View Options window).  Point toward the Southern horizon, and change the
time to Noon, and the date to something in the middle of Summer.  Note the
height of the Sun above the horizon.  Change the date to something in the middle
of winter, but keep the time at 12:00 noon.  The Sun is now much lower in the
sky.
