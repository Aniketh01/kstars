<h1>The Ecliptic</h1>
The ecliptic is an imaginary <a href="greatcircle.html">great circle</a> 
on the <a href="csphere.html">Celestial Sphere</a> along which the Sun 
appears to move over the course of a year.  Of course, it is really the 
Earth's orbit around the Sun causing the change in the Sun's apparent 
direction.  The ecliptic is inclined from the Celestial Equator by 23.5 
degrees.
<p>
Since our solar system is relatively flat, the orbits of the planets are
also close to the plane of the ecliptic.  In addition, the constellations of the
zodiac are located along the ecliptic. This makes the ecliptic a very useful
line of reference to anyone attempting to locate the planets or the
constellations of the zodiac, since they all literally 'follow the sun.'
<p>
The ecliptic shifts with the seasons, since the earth tilts such that the
southern hemisphere faces more directly toward the sun during the winter
months, and the northern hemisphere faces more directly toward the sun in the
summer. The two points where the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator are
known as the <a href="equinox.html">equinoxes</a>.
