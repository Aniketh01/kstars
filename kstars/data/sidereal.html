<h1>Sidereal Time</h1>

<p>
Sidereal Time literally means "star time".  The time we are used to using
in our everyday lives is Solar Time.  The fundamantal unit of Solar Time is
a <b>Day</b>: the time it takes the Sun to travel 360 degrees around the
sky, due to the rotation of the Earth.  Smaller units of Solar Time are
just divisions of a Day:
</p>

<ul>
<li>1/24 Day = 1 Hour
<li>1/60 Hour = 1 Minute
<li>1/60 Minute = 1 Second
</ul>

<p>
However, there is a problem with Solar Time.  The Earth doesn't actually
spin around 360 degrees in one Solar Day.  The Earth is in orbit around the
Sun, and over the course of one day, it moves about one Degree along its
orbit (360 degrees/365.25 Days for a full orbit = about one degree per
day).  So, in 24 hours, the direction toward the Sun changes by  about a
degree.  Therefore, the Earth only has to spin 359 degrees to make
the Sun look like it has traveled the full 360 degrees across the Sky.
</p><p>
In astronomy, we are concerned with how long it takes the Earth to spin
with respect to the "fixed" stars, not the Sun.  So, we would like a
timescale that removes the complication of Earth's orbit around the Sun,
and just focuses on how long it takes the Earth to spin 360 degrees with
respect to the stars.  This rotational period is called a <b>Sidereal
Day</b>.  On average, it is 4 minutes longer than a Solar Day, because of
the extra 1 degree the Earth must rotate to make a full 360-degree spin.
Rather than defining a Sidereal Day to be 24 hours, 4 minutes, we define
Sidereal Hours, Minutes and Seconds that are the same fraction of a Day as
their Solar counterparts.  Therefore, one Sidereal Second = 1.00278 Solar
Seconds.
</p><p>
Since the Earth spins at a constant rate(<a href="#footnote1">*</a>), the
Sidereal Time is useful for determining where the stars are at any
given time.  Sidereal Time divides one full spin of the Earth into 24
Sidereal Hours; similarly, the map of the sky is divided into 24 Hours
of <a href="skycoords.html#equatorial">Right Ascension</a>.  This is no
coincidence; Local Sidereal Time (LST) indicates the Right Ascension
on the sky that is currently crossing the
<a href="meridian.html">local meridian</a>. So, if a star has a Right
Ascension of 5h 32m 24s, it will be on your meridian at LST=05:32:24. More
generally, the difference between an object's RA and the Local Sidereal
Time tells you how far from the meridian the object is.  For example, the
same object at LST=06:32:24 (one Sidereal Hour later), will be one Hour of
Right Ascension west of your meridian, which is 15 degrees. This angular
distance from the meridian is called the object's
<a href="hourangle.html">Hour Angle</a>.
</p><p>
<small><a name="footnote1">*</a>: Actually, the Earth's spin is slowly
decellerating due to tidal drag from the Moon.  However, over the course of
days, years, even decades, the slowdown is nearly undetectable.</small>

<b>Exercises:</b><br />
The Local Sidereal Time is displayed by KStars in the Info Panel, with the 
label "ST:".  Note that the changing of sidereal seconds are not 
synchronized with the changing Local Time and Universal Time seconds.  In 
fact, if you watch the clocks for a while, you will notice that the 
Sidereal seconds really are slightly longer than the LT and UT seconds.
</p><p>
Select <b>Zenith</b> from the <b>Location Menu</b>.  The <a
href="zenith.html">Zenith</a> is the point on the sky where you are looking
"straight up" from the ground, and it is a point on your local meridian.
Zoom in on the Zenith and note its Right Ascension.  It will always be
exactly the same as your Local Sidereal Time.
