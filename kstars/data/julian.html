<h1>Julian Day</h1>
The Julian Calendar is a way of reckoning the current date by a simple count of
the number of days that have passed since some remote, arbitrary date.  This
number of days is called the <b>Julian Day</b> (or Julian Date), abbreviated as
JD. The starting point, JD=0, is January 1, 4713 BC (or -4712 January 1, since
there was no year '0').  Julian dates are very useful because they make it easy
to determine the number of days between two events by simply adding or
subtracting their Julian Day numbers.  Such a calculation is difficult for the
standard (Gregorian) calendar, because days are grouped into months, which can
contain a variable number of days, and there is the added complication of <a

<p>
Converting from the standard (Gregorian) calendar to Julian days and vice versa
is best left to a special program written to do this, and there are many to be
found on the web. However, for the interested, here is an example of a Gregorian
to Julian day converter:
<p>
<bold>
JD=K-32075+1461*(I+4800+(J-14)/12)/4+367*(J-2-(J-14)/12*12)/12-3*((I+4900+(J-14)/12)/100)/4
</bold>
<br>
where: I=year (1801-2099)*, J=month (1-12), K=Day (1-31), JD=Julian Day<br>
*: Note that this simple formula only works for Gregorian dates between years
1801 and 2099.
<p>
An example Julian day:<br>
Jan. 1, 1970 at noon = JD 2440588
<p>
You can also tell time with Julian Day numbers; the time of day is expressed as
a fraction of a full day, with 12:00 noon as the zeropoint.  So, 3:00 pm on Jan
1, 1970 = JD 2440588.125.
<p>
The Julian Day is always calculated from <a
href="ut.html">Universal Time</a>, not local time.
<p>
Astronomers use certain Julian Day values as important reference points, called
<b>epochs</b>.  One widely-used epoch is called J2000: it is the Julian Day for
Jan 1, 2000 at 12:00 noon = JD 2451545.0.
