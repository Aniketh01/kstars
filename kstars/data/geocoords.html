<h1>Geographic Coordinates</h1>

Locations on Earth can be specified using a spherical coordinate system.
The geographic ("earth-mapping") coordinate system is aligned
with the spin axis of the Earth.  It defines two angles measured from
the center of the Earth.  One angle, called the <b>latitude</b>,
measures the angle between any point and the Equator.  The other angle,
called the <b>longitude</b>, measures the angle <i>along</i> the
Equator, from an arbitrary point on the Earth (Greenwich, England is the
accepted zero-longitude point in most modern societies).
<p>
By combining these two angles, any location on Earth can be specified.
For example, Baltimore, Maryland (USA) has a latitude of 39.3 degrees
North, and a longitude of 76.6 degrees West.  So, a vector drawn from
the center of the Earth to a point 39.3 degrees above the Equator and
76.6 degrees west of Greenwich, England will pass through Baltimore.
<p>
The Equator is obviously an important part of this coordinate system, it
representing the <i>zeropoint</i> of the latitude angle, and the halfway
point between the poles.  The Equator is the <b>fundamental plane</b> of
the geographic coordinate system.  <a href="skycoords.html">All
spherical coordinate systems</a> define such a fundamental plane.
<p>
Lines of constant latitude are called parallels.  They trace circles
on the surface of the Earth, but the only parallel that is a <a
href="greatcircle.html">Great Circle</a> is the Equator (latitude=0
degrees).  Lines of constant Longitude are called meridians.  The
meridian passing through Greenwich is the Prime Meridian (longitude=0
degrees).  Unlike parallels, all meridians are great cricles, and
meridians are not parallel: they intersect at the north and south poles.
<p>
<hr>
<b>Exercise:</b> What is the longitude of the North Pole?  It's latitude
is 90 degrees North.
<p>
It's sort of a trick question.  The longitude is meaningless at the
north pole.  It has all longitudes at the same time.
