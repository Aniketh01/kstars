<h1>Time Zones</h1>
<p>
The Earth is round, and it is always half-illuminated by the Sun.  However,
because the Earth is spinning, the half that is illuminated is always changing.
We experience this as the passing of days wherever we are on the Earth's
surface.  At any given instant, there are places on the Earth passing from the
dark half into the illuminated half (which is seen as <i>dawn</i> on the
surface).  At the same instant, on the opposite side of the Earth, points are
passing from the illuminated half into darkness (which is seen as <i>dusk</i> at
those locations).  So, at any given time, different places on Earth are
experiencing different parts of the day.  Thus, Solar time is defined locally,
so that the clock time at any location describes the part of the day
consistently.
</p><p>
This is done by dividing the globe into 24 vertical slices called <b>time
zones</b>, and the local time in each zone is an hour earlier than the time
in the neighboring zone to the east.  The time zone boundaries are not usually
exact vertical meridian lines, because they often follow national boundaries and
other political considerations.
