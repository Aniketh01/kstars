<h1>The Equinoxes</h1>
Most people know the Vernal and Autumnal Equinoxes as calendar dates,
signifying the beginning of the northern hemisphere's spring and autumn, 
respectively.  Did you know that the equinoxes are also positions in the sky?
<p>
The Celestial Equator and the <a href="ecliptic.html">Ecliptic</a> are two
<a href="greatcircle.html">great circles</a> on the 
<a href="csphere.html">celestial sphere</a>, set at an angle of 23.5 
degrees.  The two points where they intersect are called the 
<b>equinoxes</b>.  The Vernal Equinox has coordinates RA=0.0 hours, Dec=0.0
degrees.  The Autumnal Equinox has coordinates RA=12.0 hours, Dec=0.0 
degrees.  
<p>
The Equinoxes are important for marking the seasons.  Because they are on 
the <a href="ecliptic.html">ecliptic</a>, the Sun passes through each 
equinox every year.  When the Sun passes through the Vernal Equinox (on
March 21st), it crosses the celestial equator from south to north, 
signifying the end of winter for the northern hemisphere.  Similarly, when
the Sun passes through the Autumnal Equinox (on September 21st), it crosses
the equator from north to south, signifying the end of winter for the 
southern hemisphere.
