<h1>Horizon</h1>

<p>
The horizon is the line that separates Earth from Sky.  More
precisely, it is the line that divides all of the directions you can
possibly look into two categories: those which intersect the Earth,
and those which do not.  Under many conditions, the Horizon is
obscured by trees, buildings, mountains, etc.  However, if you are on
a ship at sea, the horizon is strikingly apparent.
</p><p>
The horizon is the fundamental plane of the <a
href="skycoords.html#horizontal">Horizontal celestial coordinate
system</a>.  In other words, it is the locus of points which have an
<b>altitude</b> of zero degrees.
