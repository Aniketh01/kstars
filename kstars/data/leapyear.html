<h1>Leap Years</h1>
<p>
The Earth has two major components of motion.  First, it spins on its rotational
axis; a full spin rotation takes one <b>day</b> to complete.  Second, it orbits
around the Sun; a full orbital rotation takes one <b>year</b> to complete.
</p><p>
There are normally 365 days in one <i>calendar</i> year, but it turns out
that a <i>true</i> year (i.e., a full orbit of the Earth around the Sun; called
a <b>tropical year</b>) is a little bit longer than 365 days.  In other words,
in the time it takes the Earth to complete one orbital circuit, it completes
365.24219 spin rotations.  Don't be too suprised by this; there's no reason to
expect the spin and orbital motions of the Earth to be synchronized in any way.
It does make marking calendar time a bit awkward, however!
</p><p>
What would happen if we simply ignored the extra 0.24219 rotation at the end of
the year, and simply defined a calendar year to always be 365.0 days long?  The
calendar is basically a charting of the Earth's progress around the Sun.  If we
ignore the extra bit at the end of each year, then with every passing year, the
calendar date lags a little more behind the true position of Earth around the
Sun.  In a few centuries, Winter will begin in September!
</p><p>
In fact, it used to be that all years <i>were</i> defined to have 365.0 days,
and the calendar "drifted" away from the true seasons as a result.  In the year
46 BCE, Julius Caeser established the <b>Julian Calendar</b>, which implemented
the world's first <b>leap years</b>:  He decreed that every 4th year would be
366 days long, so that a year was 365.25 days long, on average.  This basically
solved the calendar drift problem.
</p><p>
However, the problem wasn't completely solved by the Julian calendar, because a
tropical year isn't 365.25 days long; it's 365.24219 days long!  You still have
a calendar drift problem, it just takes many centuries to become
noticeable.  And so, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII instituted the <b>Gregorian
calendar</b>, which was largely the same as the Julian Calendar, with one more
trick added for leap years: even Century years (those ending with the digits
"00") are only leap years if they are divisible by 400.  So, the years 1700,
1800, and 1900 were not leap years (though they would have been under the Julian
calendar), whereas the year 2000 <i>was</i> a leap year.  This change makes the
average length of a year 365.2425 days.  So, there is still a tiny calendar
drift, but it amounts to only 3 days in 10,000 years!  The Gregorian calendar
is still used as a standard calendar throughout most of the world.

Fun trivia: When Pope Gregory instituted the Gregorian calendar, the Julian
Calendar had been followed for over 1500 years, and so the calendar date had
already drifted by over a week.  Pope Gregory re-synchronized the calendar by
simply <i>eliminating</i> 10 days!  In 1582, the day after October 4th was
October 15th!
