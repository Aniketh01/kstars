<h1>Hour Angle</h1>
<p>
As explained in the <a href="sidereal.html">Sidereal Time</a> article, the
<a href="skycoords.html#equatorial">Right Ascension</a> of an object indicates
the Sidereal time at which it will transit across your <a
href="meridian.html">Local Meridian</a>.  An object's <b>Hour Angle</b> is
defined as the difference between the current Local Sidereal Time and the Right
Ascension of an object:
</p><p>
<code>HA<sub>obj</sub> = LST - RA<sub>obj</sub>
</p><p>
Thus, the object's Hour Angle indicates how much (sidereal) time has passed
since the object was on the local meridian.  It is also the angular distance
between the object and the meridian, measured in hours (1 hour = 15 degrees).
For example, if an object has an hour angle of 2.5 hours, it transited across
the Local Meridian 2.5 hours ago, and is currently 37.5 degrees West of the
Meridian.  Negative Hour angles indicate the time until the <i>next</i> transit.
Of course, an Hour Angle of zero means the object is currently on the Local
Meridian.
