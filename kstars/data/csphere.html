<h1>Celestial Sphere</h1>

<p>
The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of gigantic radius, centered
on the Earth.  All objects which can be seen in the sky can be thought
of as lying on the surface of this sphere.
</p><p>
Of course, we know that the objects in the sky are not <i>really</i>
on the surface of a sphere centered on the Earth, so why bother with
such a construct?  Everything we see in the sky is so very far away,
that their distances are impossible to gauge just by looking at them.
Since their distances are indeterminate, you only need to know the
<i>direction</i> toward the object to locate it in the sky.  In this
sense, the celestial sphere model is a very practical model for
mapping the sky.

You can pinpoint the positions of stars and other objects on the
celestail sphere using a <a href="skycoords.html">celestial coordinate
system</a>.
