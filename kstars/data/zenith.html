<h1>The Zenith</h1>

The Zenith is the point in the sky where you are looking when you look
"straight up".  More precisely, it is the point on the sky with an
<b>Altitude</b> of 90 degrees, so it is the pole of the <a
href="skycoords.html#horizontal">Horizontal coordinate system</a>.  
Geometrically, it is the point on the <a href="csphere.html">celestial 
sphere</a> intersected by a line drawn from the center of the Earth 
through your location on its surface.
<p>
The Zenith is, by definition, a point along the <a
href="meridian.html">Local Meridian</a>.
