<h1>Coordinate Systems</h1>
<p>
A basic requirement for studying the heavens is determining where in the
sky things are.  To specify sky positions, astronomers have developed
several <b>coordinate systems</b>.  Each uses a coordinate grid
projected on the <a href="csphere.html">Celestial Sphere</a>, in
analogy to the <a href="geocoords.html">Geographic coordinate
system</a> used on the surface of the Earth.  The coordinate systems
differ only in their choice of the <b>fundamental plane</b>, which
divides the sky into two equal hemispheres along a <a
href="greatcircle.html">great circle</a>. (the fundamental plane of the
geographic system is the Earth's equator). Each coordinate system is named for
its choice of fundamental plane.
</p><p>
<a name="equatorial"><b>The Equatorial Coordinate System</b></a><br />
The equatorial coordinate system is probably the most widely used
astronomical coordinate system.  It is also the most closely related to
the geographic coordinate system, because they use the same fundamental
plane, and the same poles.  The projection of the Earth's equator
onto the celestial sphere is called the Celestial Equator.  Similarly,
projecting the geographic Poles onto the celestial sphere defines the
North and South <a href="cpoles.html">Celestial Poles</a>.
</p><p>
However, there is an important difference between the equatorial and
geographic coordinate systems: the geographic system is fixed to the
Earth; it rotates as the Earth does.  The Equatorial system is
fixed to the sky(<a href="#footnote1">*</a>), so it appears to rotate
across the sky with the stars, but of course it's really the Earth
rotating under the fixed sky.
</p><p>
The <i>latitudinal</i> (latitude-like) angle of the Equatorial system is
called <b>Declination</b> (Dec for short).  It measures the angle of an
object above or below the celestial equator.  The <i>longitudinal</i>
angle is called <b>Right Ascension</b> (RA for short).  It measures the
angle of an object East of the <a href="equinox.html">Vernal
Equinox</a>.  Unlike longitude, Right Ascension is usually measured in
<b>hours</b> instead of degrees, because the apparent rotation of the
Equatorial coordinate system is closely related to <a
href="sidereal.html">Sidereal Time</a> and <a
href="hourangle.html">Hour Angle</a>.  Since there are 24 hours in one
full rotation (which is also 360 degrees), there are (360/24)=15 degrees
in one hour of Right Ascension.
</p><p>
<a name="horizontal"><b>The Horizontal Coordinate System</b></a><br />
The Horizontal coordinate system uses the observer's local
<b>horizon</b> as the fundamental plane.  This conveniently divides the
sky into the upper hemisphere that you can see, and the lower hemisphere
that you can't (because the Earth is in the way).  The pole of the upper
hemisphere is the <a href="zenith.html">zenith</a>.  The pole of the
lower hemisphere is called the <b>nadir</b>, which is fun trivia for
cocktail parties, but of limited utility otherwise.  The angle of an
object above or below the horizon is called the <b>Altitude</b>.  The angle 
of an object around the horizon (measured from the
North point, toward the East) is called the <b>Azimuth</b>.  The
horizontal coordinate system is sometimes called the Altitude/Azimuth system
(or the Alt/Az system, for short).
</p><p>
The horizontal system is obviously fixed to the Earth, not the sky; so
the horizontal coordinates of an object change over time as the Earth
rotates.  In addition, it is defined <b>locally</b>; so the same object
observed from different geographic locations at the same time will have
different horizontal coordinates.
</p><p>
Horizontal coordinates are very useful for determining <b>rise and set
times</b> for objects in the sky.  When an object has Altitude=0
degrees, it is either rising (if its Azimuth is &lt; 180 degrees) or
setting (if its Azimuth is &gt; 180 degrees).
</p><p>
<a name="ecliptic"><b>The Ecliptic Coordinate System</b></a><br />
The Ecliptic coordinate system uses the <a
href="ecliptic.html">Ecliptic</a> for its fundamental plane.  The
Ecliptic is the path that the Sun appears to follow across the sky over
the course of a year.  It is also the projection of the Earth's
orbital plane onto the <a href="csphere.html">Celestial Sphere</a>.  The
latitudinal angle is called the <b>Ecliptic Latitude</b>, and the longitudinal
angle is called the <b>Ecliptic Longitude</b>.  The zeropoint of the Ecliptic
Longitude angle is the <a href="equinox.html">Vernal Equinox</a>.
</p><p>
What do you think such a coordinate system would be useful for?  If you
guessed charting solar system objects, you're right!  Each of the
planets (except Pluto) orbits the Sun in <i>roughly</i> the same plane,
so they always appear to be somewhere near the Ecliptic (i.e., they
always have small ecliptic latitudes).
</p><p>
The Ecliptic passes through 13 constellations in the sky.  These
constellations are commonly called the <b>zodiac</b>.  The charting of
the planets as they wander along the Ecliptic, and through 12 of
the 13 constellations(<a href="#footnote2">**</a>) is the central
concern of the widespread superstition called <b>astrology</b>.  While
many so-called astrologers are content with knowing which planets are in
which constellations, there are some "hardcore" astrologers that do
really extensive celestial mechanics calculations to get their
predictions just right.  It's all in good fun now, but in some earlier
societies, astrology was serious business,
and the court astrologer could be executed for a poor prediction!
</p><p>
<a name="galactic"><b>The Galactic Coordinate System</b></a><br />
The Galactic coordinate system uses the <a
href="milkyway.html">Milky Way</a> as its fundamental plane.  The
latitudinal angle is called the <b>Galactic Latitude</b>, and the
longitudinal angle is called the <b>Galactic Longitude</b>.  This
coordinate system is useful for studying the Galaxy itself.  For
example, you might want to know how the density of stars changes as a
function of Galactic Latitude, to figure out the degree to which the
disk of the Milky Way is flattened.

<a name="footnote1">*</a>: almost, but not quite; see <a
href="precession.html">precession</a> and <a
href="nutation.html">nutation</a>.  Also, if you use <a
href="hourangle.html">Hour Angle</a> in place of Right Ascension, then
the Equatorial system <i>is</i> fixed to the Earth.
</p><p>
<a name="footnote2">**</a>: The 13th constellation of the zodiac that is
never used in astrology is <b>Ophiucus</b>.  Try entering your birthday
as the date in KStars; if the Sun is in Ophiucus, then your sign is
"Ophiucan"!  Congratulations, you can now amaze and baffle all of
your astrologically-inclined friends.
