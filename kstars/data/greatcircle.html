<h1>Great Circle</h1>

<p>
Consider a sphere, such as the Earth, or the <a href="csphere.html">Celestial
Sphere</a>.  The intersection of any plane with the sphere will result in a 
circle on the surface of the sphere.  If the plane happens to contain the 
center of the sphere, the intersection circle is a <b>great
circle</b>.  Great circles are the largest circles that can be drawn
on a sphere.  Also, the shortest path between any two points on a
sphere is always along a great circle. 
</p><p>
Some examples of great circles on the celestial sphere include: the horizon, 
the celestial equator, and the <a href="ecliptic.html">ecliptic</a>.
