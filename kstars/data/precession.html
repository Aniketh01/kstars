<h1>Precession</h1>
<p>
Precession is the gradual change in the direction of the Earth's spin axis.
The spin axis traces a cone, completing a full circuit in 26,000 years.
If you've ever spun a top or a dreidel, the "wobbling" rotation of the top
as it spins is precession.
</p><p>
Because the direction of the spin axis changes, so does the location of the
<a href="cpoles.html">celestial poles</a>.
</p><p>
The reason for the Earth's precession is complicated.  The Earth is not a
perfect sphere, it is a bit flattened, meaning the 
<a href="greatcircle.html">great circle</a> of the equator is longer than 
a <i>meridonal</i> great circle that
passes through the poles.  Also, the Moon and Sun lie outside the Earth's
Equatorial plane.  As a result, the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun on
the oblate Earth includes a slight <i>torque</i> in addition to a linear force.
This torque on the spinning body of the Earth leads to the precessional motion.

<b>Exercise:</b><br />
Precession is most easy to see by observing the
<a href="cpoles.html">celestial pole</a>.  Find the Pole by switching to
Equatorial coordinates in the <b>View Options</b> window, and then holding
down the Up-arrow key until the sky map stops scrolling (the declination
should be +90 degrees, and the bright star Polaris is nearly at the center
of the screen).  Try slewing with the left and right arrow keys.  Notice
that the sky appears to rotate around the pole.
</p><p>
Now we're going to change the date and observe that the pole has precessed
to a new location in the sky.  Open the <b>Set Time</b> window
(<tt>Ctrl+S</tt>), and set the date to the year 8000 (currently, KStars
will not allow dates much more remote than this).  Notice that we are now
pointing between the constellations Cygnus and Cepheus.  Veryify that this
is actually the pole by slewing left and right: the sky rotates about this
point; in the year 8000, the North celestial pole will no longer be near
Polaris!
