<h1>The Celestial Poles</h1>

The sky appears to drift overhead from east to west, completing a full circuit 
around the sky in 24 (<a href="sidereal.html">sidereal</a>) hours.  This 
phenomenon is due to the spinning of the Earth on its axis.  The Earth's 
spin axis intersects the <a href="csphere.html">celestial sphere</a> at two points.
These points are the <b>celestial poles</b>; they remain stationary, and the 
entire sky seems to rotate around them.  The celestial poles are also the 
poles of the <a href="skycoords.html#equatorial">equatorial coordinate 
system</a>, meaning they have declinations of +90 degrees and -90 degrees
(for the North and South celestial poles, respectively). 
<p>
The North Celestial Pole currently has nearly the same coordinates as 
the bright star <b>Polaris</b> (which means "pole star").  This makes 
Polaris useful for navigation: not only is it always above the North point 
of the horizon, but its <i>altitude</i> angle is always (nearly) equal to 
the observer's <a href="geocoords.html">geographic latitude</a> (however, 
Polaris can only be seen from the Earth's northern hemisphere).
<p>
The fact that Polaris is near the pole is purely a coincidence.  In fact, 
because of <a href="precession.html">precession</a>, Polaris is only near
the pole for a small fraction of the time.

<b>Exercises</b>:<br>
Use the <b>Find Object</b> window (<tt>Ctrl+F</tt>) to locate Polaris.  
Notice that its declination is almost (but not exactly) +90 degrees.  
Compare the Altitude reading when focused on Polaris to your location's 
geographic latitude.  They are always within one degree of each other.  
They are not exactly the same because Polaris isn't exactly at the Pole.
(you can point <i>exactly</i> at the pole by switching to Equatorial 
coordinates, and pressing the up-arrow key until the sky stops scrolling).
<p>
Use the <b>time-step</b> spinbox in the toolbar to accelerate time to a 
step of 100 seconds.  You can see the entire sky appears to rotate around 
Polaris, while Polaris itself remains nearly stationary.
<p>
We said that the celestial pole is the pole of the Equatorial coordinate 
system.  What do you think is the pole of the horizontal (Altitude/Azimuth)
coordinate system?  For the answer, highlight here:
