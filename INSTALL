This file assumes you have already downloaded the KStars source since
you are reading it, otherwise get it from KDE git repo at git://anongit.kde.org/kstars.git

After that you need to do only a handful of steps

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/kde4/install/dir ..
make
make install

Obviously /path/to/your/kde4/install/dir is not a real path, you need to choose what you want to do:
 * Use the value returned by kde4-config --prefix
   - Will install it in the same prefix than your system kdelibs is installed
   - Will overwrite your distribution KStars if you have it installed
   - Will probably need administrator password
 * Use a random subdirectory in your home, e.g. /home/myuser/kstars_install
   - You will need to run 
 	export KDEDIRS=/home/myuser/kstars_install:$(kde4-config --prefix)
	kbuildsycoca4
   - You will need to make sure the /home/myuser/kstars_install/bin is in your PATH environment variable


Happy hacking!
